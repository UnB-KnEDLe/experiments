 EU  rejects  German  call  to  boycott  British  lamb  
     Peter  Blackburn      BRUSSELS  1996-08-22      The  European  Commission  said  on  Thursday  it  disagreed  with  German  advice  to  consumers  to  shun  British  lamb  until  scientists  determine  whether  mad  cow  disease  can  be  transmitted  to  sheep  
     Germany  's  representative  to  the  European  Union  's  veterinary  committee  Werner  Zwingmann  said  on  Wednesday  consumers  should  buy  sheepmeat  from  countries  other  than  Britain  until  the  scientific  advice  was  clearer  
    "  We  do  n't  support  any  such  recommendation  because  we  do  n't  see  any  grounds  for  it , "  the  Commission  's  chief  spokesman  Nikolaus  van  der  Pas  told  a  news  briefing  
     He  said  further  scientific  study  was  required  and  if  it  was  found  that  action  was  needed  it  should  be  taken  by  the  European  Union  
     He  said  a  proposal  last  month  by  EU  Farm  Commissioner  Franz  Fischler  to  ban  sheep  brains ,  spleens  and  spinal  cords  from  the  human  and  animal  food  chains  was  a  highly  specific  and  precautionary  move  to  protect  human  health  
     Fischler  proposed  EU-wide  measures  after  reports  from  Britain  and  France  that  under  laboratory  conditions  sheep  could  contract  Bovine  Spongiform  Encephalopathy (  BSE )  --  mad  cow  disease  
     But  Fischler  agreed  to  review  his  proposal  after  the  EU  's  standing  veterinary  committee ,  mational  animal  health  officials ,  questioned  if  such  action  was  justified  as  there  was  only  a  slight  risk  to  human  health  
     Spanish  Farm  Minister  Loyola  de  Palacio  had  earlier  accused  Fischler  at  an  EU  farm  ministers  '  meeting  of  causing  unjustified  alarm  through "  dangerous  generalisation  
"      
     Only  France  and  Britain  backed  Fischler  's  proposal  
     The  EU  's  scientific  veterinary  and  multidisciplinary  committees  are  due  to  re-examine  the  issue  early  next  month  and  make  recommendations  to  the  senior  veterinary  officials  
     Sheep  have  long  been  known  to  contract  scrapie ,  a  brain-wasting  disease  similar  to  BSE  which  is  believed  to  have  been  transferred  to  cattle  through  feed  containing  animal  waste  
     British  farmers  denied  on  Thursday  there  was  any  danger  to  human  health  from  their  sheep ,  but  expressed  concern  that  German  government  advice  to  consumers  to  avoid  British  lamb  might  influence  consumers  across  Europe  
    "  What  we  have  to  be  extremely  careful  of  is  how  other  countries  are  going  to  take  Germany  's  lead , "  Welsh  National  Farmers  '  Union (  NFU )  chairman  John  Lloyd  Jones  said  on  BBC  radio  
     Bonn  has  led  efforts  to  protect  public  health  after  consumer  confidence  collapsed  in  March  after  a  British  report  suggested  humans  could  contract  an  illness  similar  to  mad  cow  disease  by  eating  contaminated  beef  
     Germany  imported  47,600  sheep  from  Britain  last  year ,  nearly  half  of  total  imports  
     It  brought  in  4,275  tonnes  of  British  mutton ,  some  10  percent  of  overall  imports

     LONDON  1996-08-22      A  rare  early  handwritten  draft  of  a  song  by  U.S.  guitar  legend  Jimi  Hendrix  was  sold  for  almost $  17,000  on  Thursday  at  an  auction  of  some  of  the  late  musician  's  favourite  possessions  
     A  Florida  restaurant  paid  10,925  pounds ( $  16,935 )  for  the  draft  of "  Ai  n't  no  telling " ,  which  Hendrix  penned  on  a  piece  of  London  hotel  stationery  in  late  1966  
     At  the  end  of  a  January  1967  concert  in  the  English  city  of  Nottingham  he  threw  the  sheet  of  paper  into  the  audience ,  where  it  was  retrieved  by  a  fan  
     Buyers  also  snapped  up  16  other  items  that  were  put  up  for  auction  by  Hendrix  's  former  girlfriend  Kathy  Etchingham ,  who  lived  with  him  from  1966  to  1969  
     They  included  a  black  lacquer  and  mother  of  pearl  inlaid  box  used  by  Hendrix  to  store  his  drugs ,  which  an  anonymous  Australian  purchaser  bought  for  5,060  pounds ( $  7,845 )  
     The  guitarist  died  of  a  drugs  overdose  in  1970  aged  27

     BEIJING  1996-08-22      China  on  Thursday  accused  Taipei  of  spoiling  the  atmosphere  for  a  resumption  of  talks  across  the  Taiwan  Strait  with  a  visit  to  Ukraine  by  Taiwanese  Vice  President  Lien  Chan  this  week  that  infuriated  Beijing  
     Speaking  only  hours  after  Chinese  state  media  said  the  time  was  right  to  engage  in  political  talks  with  Taiwan ,  Foreign  Ministry  spokesman  Shen  Guofang  told  Reuters  : "  The  necessary  atmosphere  for  the  opening  of  the  talks  has  been  disrupted  by  the  Taiwan  authorities  
"      State  media  quoted  China  's  top  negotiator  with  Taipei ,  Tang  Shubei ,  as  telling  a  visiting  group  from  Taiwan  on  Wednesday  that  it  was  time  for  the  rivals  to  hold  political  talks  
    "  Now  is  the  time  for  the  two  sides  to  engage  in  political  talks  ...      that  is  to  end  the  state  of  hostility , "  Thursday  's  overseas  edition  of  the  People  's  Daily  quoted  Tang  as  saying  
     The  foreign  ministry  's  Shen  told  Reuters  Television  in  an  interview  he  had  read  reports  of  Tang  's  comments  but  gave  no  details  of  why  the  negotiator  had  considered  the  time  right  for  talks  with  Taiwan ,  which  Beijing  considers  a  renegade  province  
     China ,  which  has  long  opposed  all  Taipei  efforts  to  gain  greater  international  recognition ,  was  infuriated  by  a  visit  to  Ukraine  this  week  by  Taiwanese  Vice  President  Lien

     Consultations  should  be  held  to  set  the  time  and  format  of  the  talks ,  the  official  Xinhua  news  agency  quoted  Tang  Shubei ,  executive  vice  chairman  of  the  Association  for  Relations  Across  the  Taiwan  Straits ,  as  saying  late  on  Wednesday  
     -DOCSTART-      German  July  car  registrations  up  14.2  pct  yr  /  yr  
     FRANKFURT  1996-08-22      German  first-time  registrations  of  motor  vehicles  jumped  14.2  percent  in  July  this  year  from  the  year-earlier  period ,  the  Federal  office  for  motor  vehicles  said  on  Thursday  
     The  office  said  356,725  new  cars  were  registered  in  July  1996  --  304,850  passenger  cars  and  15,613  trucks  
     The  figures  represent  a  13.6  percent  increase  for  passenger  cars  and  a  2.2  percent  decline  for  trucks  from  July  1995  
     Motor-bike  registration  rose  32.7  percent  in  the  period  
     The  growth  was  partly  due  to  an  increased  number  of  Germans  buying  German  cars  abroad ,  while  manufacturers  said  that  domestic  demand  was  weak ,  the  federal  office  said  
     Almost  all  German  car  manufacturers  posted  gains  in  registration  numbers  in  the  period  
     Volkswagen  AG  won  77,719  registrations ,  slightly  more  than  a  quarter  of  the  total  
     Opel  AG  together  with  General  Motors  came  in  second  place  with  49,269  registrations ,  16.4  percent  of  the  overall  figure  
     Third  was  Ford  with  35,563  registrations ,  or  11.7  percent  
     Only  Seat  and  Porsche  had  fewer  registrations  in  July  1996  compared  to  last  year  's  July  
     Seat  posted  3,420  registrations  compared  with  5522  registrations  in  July  a  year  earlier

     -DOCSTART-      Israel  plays  down  fears  of  war  with  Syria  
     Colleen  Siegel      JERUSALEM  1996-08-22      Israel  's  outgoing  peace  negotiator  with  Syria  said  on  Thursday  current  tensions  between  the  two  countries  appeared  to  be  a  storm  in  a  teacup  
     Itamar  Rabinovich ,  who  as  Israel  's  ambassador  to  Washington  conducted  unfruitful  negotiations  with  Syria ,  told  Israel  Radio  it  looked  like  Damascus  wanted  to  talk  rather  than  fight  
    "  It  appears  to  me  the  Syrian  priority  is  still  to  negotiate  
     The  Syrians  are  confused ,  they  are  definitely  tense ,  but  the  general  assessment  here  in  Washington  is  that  this  is  essentially  a  storm  in  a  teacup , "  he  said  
     Rabinovich  is  winding  up  his  term  as  ambassador  
     He  will  be  replaced  by  Eliahu  Ben-Elissar ,  a  former  Israeli  envoy  to  Egypt  and  right-wing  Likud  party  politician  
     Israel  on  Wednesday  sent  Syria  a  message ,  via  Washington ,  saying  it  was  committed  to  peace  and  wanted  to  open  negotiations  without  preconditions  
     But  it  slammed  Damascus  for  creating  what  it  called  a  dangerous  atmosphere  
     Syria  accused  Israel  on  Wednesday  of  launching  a  hysterical  campaign  against  it  after  Israeli  television  reported  that  Damascus  had  recently  test  fired  a  missile  
     It  said  its  arms  purchases  were  for  defensive  purposes  
    "  The  message  that  we  sent  to (  Syrian  President  Hafez  al- )  Assad  is  that  Israel  is  ready  at  any  time  without  preconditions  to  enter  peace  negotiations , "  Israeli  Foreign  Minister  David  Levy  told  Israel  Radio  in  an  interview  
     Tension  has  mounted  since  Israeli  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  took  office  in  June  vowing  to  retain  the  Golan  Heights  Israel  captured  from  Syria  in  the  1967  Middle  East  war  
     Israeli-Syrian  peace  talks  have  been  deadlocked  over  the  Golan  since  1991  despite  the  previous  government  's  willingness  to  make  Golan  concessions  
     Peace  talks  between  the  two  sides  were  last  held  in  February  
    "  The  voices  coming  out  of  Damascus  are  bad ,  not  good  
     The  media  ...      are  full  of  expressions  and  declarations  that  must  be  worrying  ...      this  artificial  atmosphere  is  very  dangerous  because  those  who  spread  it  could  become  its  prisoners , "  Levy  said  
    "  We  expect  from  Syria ,  if  its  face  is  to  peace ,  that  it  will  answer  Israel  's  message  to  enter  peace  negotiations  because  that  is  our  goal , "  he  said  
"      We  do  not  want  a  war ,  God  forbid  
     No  one  benefits  from  wars  
"      Israel  's  Channel  Two  television  said  Damascus  had  sent  a "  calming  signal "  to  Israel  
     It  gave  no  source  for  the  report  
     Netanyahu  and  Levy  's  spokesmen  said  they  could  not  confirm  it  
     The  television  also  said  that  Netanyahu  had  sent  messages  to  reassure  Syria  via  Cairo ,  the  United  States  and  Moscow

    "  This  is  not  true  
     Up  to  today ,  we  have  no  knowledge  of  any  nurse  stranded  or  kept  in  Libya  without  her  will ,  and  we  have  not  received  any  complaint , "  the  Polish  embassy  's  charge  d'affaires  in  Tripoli ,  Tadeusz  Awdankiewicz ,  told  Reuters  by  telephone  
     Poland  's  labour  ministry  said  this  week  it  would  send  a  team  to  Libya  to  investigate ,  but  Awdankiewicz  said  the  probe  was  prompted  by  some  nurses  complaining  about  their  work  conditions  such  as  non-payment  of  their  salaries  
     He  said  that  there  are  an  estimated  800  Polish  nurses  working  in  Libya

     A  Mujahideen  Khalq  statement  said  its  leader  Massoud  Rajavi  met  in  Baghdad  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Kurdistan  Democratic  Party  of  Iran (  KDPI )  Hassan  Rastegar  on  Wednesday  and  voiced  his  support  to  Iran  's  rebel  Kurds  
    "  Rajavi  emphasised  that  the  Iranian  Resistance  would  continue  to  stand  side  by  side  with  their  Kurdish  compatriots  and  the  resistance  movement  in  Iranian  Kurdistan , "  it  said  
     A  spokesman  for  the  group  said  the  meeting "  signals  a  new  level  of  cooperation  between  Mujahideen  Khalq  and  the  Iranian  Kurdish  oppositions "  
     Iran  heavily  bombarded  targets  in  northern  Iraq  in  July  in  pursuit  of  KDPI  guerrillas  based  in  Iraqi  Kurdish  areas  outside  the  control  of  the  government  in  Baghdad  
     Iraqi  Kurdish  areas  bordering  Iran  are  under  the  control  of  guerrillas  of  the  Iraqi  Kurdish  Patriotic  Union  of  Kurdistan (  PUK )  group  
     PUK  and  Iraq  's  Kurdistan  Democratic  Party (  KDP )  the  two  main  Iraqi  Kurdish  factions ,  have  had  northern  Iraq  under  their  control  since  Iraqi  forces  were  ousted  from  Kuwait  in  the  1991  Gulf  War  
     Clashes  between  the  two  parties  broke  out  at  the  weekend  in  the  most  serious  fighting  since  a  U.S.-sponsored  ceasefire  last  year  
     Mujahideen  Khalq  said  Iranian  troops  had  also  been  shelling  KDP  positions  in  Qasri  region  in  Suleimaniya  province  near  the  Iranian  border  over  the  last  two  days

     JERUSALEM  1996-08-22      Israel  gave  Palestinian  President  Yasser  Arafat  permission  on  Thursday  to  fly  over  its  territory  to  the  West  Bank ,  ending  a  brief  Israeli-PLO  crisis ,  an  Arafat  adviser  said  
    "  The  problem  is  over  
     The  president  's  aircraft  has  received  permission  to  pass  through  Israeli  airspace  but  the  president  is  not  expected  to  travel  to  the  West  Bank  before  Monday , "  Nabil  Abu  Rdainah  told  Reuters  
     Arafat  had  been  scheduled  to  meet  former  Israeli  prime  minister  Shimon  Peres  in  the  West  Bank  town  of  Ramallah  on  Thursday  but  the  venue  was  changed  to  Gaza  after  Israel  denied  flight  clearance  to  the  Palestinian  leader  's  helicopters  
     Palestinian  officials  accused  right-wing  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  of  trying  to  stop  the  Ramallah  meeting  by  keeping  Arafat  grounded  
     Arafat  subsequently  cancelled  a  meeting  between  Israeli  and  PLO  officials ,  on  civilian  affairs ,  at  the  Allenby  Bridge  crossing  between  Jordan  and  the  West  Bank  
     Abu  Rdainah  said  Arafat  had  decided  against  flying  to  the  West  Bank  on  Thursday ,  after  Israel  lifted  the  ban ,  because  he  had  a  busy  schedule  in  Gaza  and  would  not  be  free  until  Monday

     JERUSALEM  1996-08-22      Yasser  Arafat  will  meet  Shimon  Peres  in  Gaza  on  Thursday  after  Palestinians  said  the  right-wing  Israeli  government  had  barred  the  Palestinian  leader  from  flying  to  the  West  Bank  for  talks  with  the  former  prime  minister  
    "  The  meeting  between  Peres  and  Arafat  will  take  place  at  Erez  checkpoint  in  Gaza  and  not  in  Ramallah  as  planned , "  Peres  '  office  said

     Israeli  Prime  Minister  Benjamin  Netanyahu  has  accused  opposition  leader  Peres ,  who  he  defeated  in  May  elections ,  of  trying  to  undermine  his  Likud  government  's  authority  to  conduct  peace  talks  
     -DOCSTART-      Afghan  UAE  embassy  says  Taleban  guards  going  home  
     Hilary  Gush      DUBAI  1996-08-22      Three  Afghan  guards  brought  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates  last  week  by  Russian  hostages  who  escaped  from  the  Taleban  militia  will  return  to  Afghanistan  in  a  few  days ,  the  Afghan  embassy  in  Abu  Dhabi  said  on  Thursday  
    "  Our  ambassador  is  in  touch  with  the  UAE  foreign  ministry  
     Their  return  to  Afghanistan  will  take  place  in  two  or  three  days , "  an  embassy  official  said  
    "  The  embassy  is  issuing  them  travel  documents  for  their  return  to  their  homeland  
     There  is  no  objection  to  their  travel , "  he  added  
     The  three  Islamic  Taleban  guards  were  overpowered  by  seven  Russian  aircrew  who  escaped  to  UAE  state  Sharjah  last  Friday  on  board  their  own  aircraft  after  a  year  in  the  captivity  of  Taleban  militia  in  Kandahar  in  southern  Afghanistan  
     The  UAE  said  on  Monday  it  would  hand  over  the  three  to  the  International  Red  Crescent ,  possibly  last  Tuesday  
     It  has  since  been  silent  on  the  issue  
     When  asked  whether  the  three  guards  would  travel  back  to  Kandahar  or  the  Afghan  capital  Kabul ,  the  embassy  official  said  : "  That  has  not  been  decided ,  but  possibly  Kandahar  
"      Kandahar  is  the  headquarters  of  the  opposition  Taleban  militia  
     Kabul  is  controlled  by  President  Burhanuddin  Rabbani  's  government ,  which  Taleban  is  fighting  to  overthrow

     Taleban  said  its  shipment  of  ammunition  from  Albania  was  evidence  of  Russian  military  support  for  Rabbani  's  government

     BAGHDAD  1996-08-22      Iraqi  President  Saddam  Hussein  has  told  visiting  Russian  ultra-nationalist  Vladimir  Zhirinovsky  that  Baghdad  wanted  to  maintain "  friendship  and  cooperation "  with  Moscow ,  official  Iraqi  newspapers  said  on  Thursday  
    "  President  Saddam  Hussein  stressed  during  the  meeting  Iraq  's  keenness  to  maintain  friendship  and  cooperation  with  Russia , "  the  papers  said  
     They  said  Zhirinovsky  told  Saddam  before  he  left  Baghdad  on  Wednesday  that  his  Liberal  Democratic  party  and  the  Russian  Duma (  parliament ) "  are  calling  for  an  immediate  lifting  of  the  embargo "  imposed  on  Iraq  after  its  1990  invasion  of  Kuwait  
     Zhirinovsky  said  on  Tuesday  he  would  press  the  Russian  government  to  help  end  U.N.  trade  sanctions  on  Iraq  and  blamed  Moscow  for  delaying  establishment  of  good  ties  with  Baghdad  
    "  Our  stand  is  firm ,  namely  we  are  calling  on (  the  Russian )  government  to  end  the  economic  embargo  on  Iraq  and  resume  trade  ties  between  Russia  and  Iraq , "  he  told  reporters  
     Zhirinovsky  visited  Iraq  twice  in  1995  
     Last  October  he  was  invited  to  attend  the  referendum  held  on  Iraq  's  presidency ,  which  extended  Saddam  's  term  for  seven  more  years

     BONN  1996-08-22      Germany  's  Agriculture  Ministry  suggested  on  Wednesday  that  consumers  avoid  eating  meat  from  British  sheep  until  scientists  determine  whether  mad  cow  disease  can  be  transmitted  to  the  animals  
    "  Until  this  is  cleared  up  by  the  European  Union  's  scientific  panels  --  and  we  have  asked  this  to  be  done  as  quickly  as  possible  -- (  consumers )  should  if  at  all  possible  give  preference  to  sheepmeat  from  other  countries , "  ministry  official  Werner  Zwingmann  told  ZDF  television  
    "  I  do  not  want  to  say  that  there  is  a  concrete  danger  for  consumers , "  he  added  
"      There  are  too  many  holes  in  what  we  know ,  and  these  must  be  filled  very  quickly  
"      Bonn  has  led  efforts  to  ensure  consumer  protection  tops  the  list  of  priorities  in  dealing  with  the  mad  cow  crisis ,  which  erupted  in  March  when  Britain  acknowledged  humans  could  contract  a  similar  illness  by  eating  contaminated  beef  
     The  European  Commission  agreed  this  month  to  rethink  a  proposal  to  ban  the  use  of  suspect  sheep  tissue  after  some  EU  veterinary  experts  questioned  whether  it  was  justified  
     EU  Farm  Commissioner  Franz  Fischler  had  proposed  banning  sheep  brains ,  spleens  and  spinal  cords  from  the  human  and  animal  food  chains  after  reports  from  Britain  and  France  that  under  laboratory  conditions  sheep  could  contract  Bovine  Spongiform  Encephalopathy (  BSE )  --  mad  cow  disease  
     But  some  members  of  the  EU  's  standing  veterinary  committee  questioned  whether  the  action  was  necessary  given  the  slight  risk  to  human  health  
     The  question  is  being  studied  separately  by  two  EU  scientific  committees  
     Sheep  have  long  been  known  to  contract  scrapie ,  a  similar  brain-wasting  disease  to  BSE  which  is  believed  to  have  been  transferred  to  cattle  through  feed  containing  animal  waste  
     British  officials  say  sheep  meat  is  perfectly  safe  to  eat  
     ZDF  said  Germany  imported  47,600  sheep  from  Britain  last  year ,  nearly  half  of  total  imports  
     It  brought  in  4,275  tonnes  of  British  mutton ,  some  10  percent  of  overall  imports  
     After  the  British  government  admitted  a  possible  link  between  mad  cow  disease  and  its  fatal  human  equivalent ,  the  EU  imposed  a  worldwide  ban  on  British  beef  exports  
     EU  leaders  agreed  at  a  summit  in  June  to  a  progressive  lifting  of  the  ban  as  Britain  takes  parallel  measures  to  eradicate  the  disease

     Blackburn  announced  on  Wednesday  they  and  Dalglish  had  parted  by  mutual  consent

"      Dalglish  had  been  with  Blackburn  for  nearly  five  years ,  first  as  manager  and  then ,  for  the  past  15  months ,  as  director  of  football

     SYDNEY  1996-08-22      Australian  Davis  Cup  captain  John  Newcombe  on  Thursday  signalled  his  possible  resignation  if  his  team  loses  an  away  tie  against  Croatia  next  month  
     The  former  Wimbledon  champion  said  the  immediate  future  of  Australia  's  Davis  Cup  coach  Tony  Roche  could  also  be  determined  by  events  in  Split  
    "  If  we  lose  this  one ,  Tony  and  I  will  have  to  have  a  good  look  at  giving  someone  else  a  go , "  Newcombe  was  quoted  as  saying  in  Sydney  's  Daily  Telegraph  newspaper  
     Australia  face  Croatia  in  the  world  group  qualifying  tie  on  clay  from  September  20-22  
     Under  Newcombe  's  leadership ,  Australia  were  relegated  from  the  elite  world  group  last  year ,  the  first  time  the  26-time  Davis  Cup  winners  had  slipped  from  the  top  rank  
     Since  taking  over  as  captain  from  Neale  Fraser  in  1994 ,  Newcombe  's  record  in  tandem  with  Roche ,  his  former  doubles  partner ,  has  been  three  wins  and  three  losses  
     Newcombe  has  selected  Wimbledon  semifinalist  Jason  Stoltenberg ,  Patrick  Rafter ,  Mark  Philippoussis ,  and  Olympic  doubles  champions  Todd  Woodbridge  and  Mark  Woodforde  to  face  the  Croatians  
     The  home  side  boasts  world  number  six  Goran  Ivanisevic ,  and  Newcombe  conceded  his  players  would  be  hard-pressed  to  beat  the  Croatian  number  one  
    "  We  are  ready  to  fight  to  our  last  breath  --  Australia  must  play  at  its  absolute  best  to  win , "  said  Newcombe ,  who  described  the  tie  as  the  toughest  he  has  faced  as  captain  
     Australia  last  won  the  Davis  Cup  in  1986 ,  but  they  were  beaten  finalists  against  Germany  three  years  ago  under  Fraser  's  guidance

     CLEVELAND  1996-08-22      Rusty  Greer  's  two-run  homer  in  the  top  of  the  10th  inning  rallied  the  Texas  Rangers  to  a  10-8  victory  over  the  Cleveland  Indians  Wednesday  in  the  rubber  game  of  a  three-game  series  between  division  leaders  
     With  one  out ,  Greer  hit  a  1-1  pitch  from  Julian  Tavarez (  4-7 )  over  the  right-field  fence  for  his  15th  home  run  
    "  It  was  an  off-speed  pitch  and  I  just  tried  to  get  a  good  swing  on  it  and  put  it  in  play , "  Greer  said  
"      This  was  a  big  game  
     The  crowd  was  behind  him  and  it  was  intense  
"      The  shot  brought  home  Ivan  Rodriguez ,  who  had  his  second  double  of  the  game ,  giving  him  42  this  season ,  41  as  a  catcher  
     He  joined  Mickey  Cochrane ,  Johnny  Bench  and  Terry  Kennedy  as  the  only  catchers  with  40  doubles  in  a  season  
     The  Rangers  have  won  10  of  their  last  12  games  and  six  of  nine  meetings  against  the  Indians  this  season  
     The  American  League  Western  leaders  have  won  eight  of  15  games  at  Jacobs  Field ,  joining  the  Yankees  as  the  only  teams  with  a  winning  record  at  the  A.L.  Central  leaders  '  home  
     Cleveland  lost  for  just  the  second  time  in  six  games  
     The  Indians  sent  the  game  into  extra  innings  in  the  ninth  on  Kenny  Lofton  's  two-run  single  
     Ed  Vosberg (  1-0 )  blew  his  first  save  opportunity  but  got  the  win ,  allowing  three  hits  with  two  walks  and  three  strikeouts  in  1  2/3  scoreless  innings  
     Dean  Palmer  hit  his  30th  homer  for  the  Rangers  
     In  Baltimore ,  Cal  Ripken  had  four  hits  and  snapped  a  fifth-inning  tie  with  a  solo  homer  and  Bobby  Bonilla  added  a  three-run  shot  in  the  seventh  to  power  the  surging  Orioles  to  a  10-5  victory  over  the  Seattle  Mariners  
     The  Mariners  scored  four  runs  in  the  top  of  the  fifth  to  tie  the  game  5-5  but  Ripken  led  off  the  bottom  of  the  inning  with  his  21st  homer  off  starter  Sterling  Hitchcock (  12-6 )  
     Bonilla  's  blast  was  the  first  time  Randy  Johnson ,  last  season  's  Cy  Young  winner ,  allowed  a  run  in  five  relief  appearances  since  coming  off  the  disabled  list  on  August  6  
     Bonilla  has  21  RBI  and  15  runs  in  his  last  20  games  
     Baltimore  has  won  seven  of  nine  and  16  of  its  last  22  and  cut  the  Yankees  '  lead  in  the  A.L.  East  to  five  games  
     Scott  Erickson (  8-10 )  laboured  to  his  third  straight  win  
     Alex  Rodriguez  had  two  homers  and  four  RBI  for  the  Mariners ,  who  have  dropped  three  in  a  row  and  11  of  15  
     He  became  the  fifth  shortstop  in  major-league  history  to  hit  30  homers  in  a  season  and  the  first  since  Ripken  hit  34  in  1991  
     Chris  Hoiles  hit  his  22nd  homer  for  Baltimore  
     In  New  York ,  Jason  Dickson  scattered  10  hits  over  6  1/3  innings  in  his  major-league  debut  and  Chili  Davis  belted  a  homer  from  each  side  of  the  plate  as  the  California  Angels  defeated  the  Yankees  7-1  
     Dickson  allowed  a  homer  to  Derek  Jeter  on  his  first  major-league  pitch  but  settled  down  
     He  was  the  27th  pitcher  used  by  the  Angels  this  season ,  tying  a  major-league  record  
     Jimmy  Key (  9-10 )  took  the  loss  as  the  Yankees  lost  their  ninth  in  14  games  
     They  stranded  11  baserunners  
     California  played  without  interim  manager  John  McNamara ,  who  was  admitted  to  a  New  York  hospital  with  a  blood  clot  in  his  right  calf  
     In  Boston ,  Mike  Stanley  's  bases-loaded  two-run  single  snapped  an  eighth-inning  tie  and  gave  the  Red  Sox  their  third  straight  win ,  6-4  over  the  Oakland  Athletics  
     Stanley  owns  a  .367  career  batting  average  with  the  bases  loaded (  33-for-90 )  
     Boston  's  Mo  Vaughn  went  3-for-3  with  a  walk ,  stole  home  for  one  of  his  three  runs  scored  and  collected  his  116th  RBI  
     Scott  Brosius  homered  and  drove  in  two  runs  for  the  Athletics ,  who  have  lost  seven  of  their  last  nine  games  
     In  Detroit ,  Brad  Ausmus  's  three-run  homer  capped  a  four-run  eighth  and  lifted  the  Tigers  to  a  7-4  victory  over  the  reeling  Chicago  White  Sox  
     The  Tigers  have  won  consecutive  games  after  dropping  eight  in  a  row ,  but  have  won  nine  of  their  last  12  at  home  
     The  White  Sox  have  lost  six  of  their  last  eight  games  
     In  Kansas  City ,  Juan  Guzman  tossed  a  complete-game  six-hitter  to  win  for  the  first  time  in  over  a  month  and  lower  his  league-best  ERA  as  the  Toronto  Blue  Jays  won  their  fourth  straight ,  6-2  over  the  Royals  
     Guzman (  10-8 )  won  for  the  first  time  since  July  16 ,  a  span  of  six  starts  
     He  allowed  two  runs  --  one  earned  --  and  lowered  his  ERA  to  2.99  
     At  Minnesota ,  John  Jaha  's  three-run  homer ,  his  26th ,  capped  a  five-run  eighth  inning  that  rallied  the  Milwaukee  Brewers  to  a  10-7  victory  over  the  Twins  
     Jaha  added  an  RBI  single  in  the  ninth  and  had  four  RBI

     The  HCFA  Administrator  reversed  a  previously  favorable  decision  regarding  the  reimbursement  of  costs  related  to  the  company  's  community  liaison  personnel ,  it  added  
     The  company  said  it  continues  to  believe  the  majority  of  the  community  liaison  costs  are  coverable  under  the  terms  of  the  Medicare  program  
    "  We  are  disappointed  with  the  administrator  's  decision  but  we  continue  to  be  optimistic  regarding  an  ultimate  favorable  resolution , "  Mark  Gildea ,  chief  executive  officer ,  said  in  a  statement

    "  Bankruptcy  is  always  possible ,  particularly  when  you  lose  what  we  are  going  to  lose  in  the  first  half  of  this  year , "  Levy  said  
"      But  this  is  not  something  we  are  striving  to  do

     Three  out  of  four  Swedish  babies  born  to  mothers  who  caught  measles  developed  serious  cases  of  Crohn  's  disease ,  the  researchers  said

     A  study  by  a  team  of  doctors  at  Oxford  University  has  found  people  with  high  blood  cholesterol  do  not  benefit  significantly  from  taking  garlic  tablets  
     The  study  involved  115  people  with  high  blood  cholesterol  levels  
     They  were  given  900  milligrams  a  day  of  dried  garlic  powder  or  placebo  tablets  
"      There  were  no  significant  differences  between  the  groups  receiving  garlic  and  placebo , "  they  wrote  in  the  Journal  of  the  Royal  College  of  Physicians  
     Those  taking  part  were  told  to  eat  a  low-fat  diet  for  six  weeks  before  they  started  taking  the  pills ,  and  their  blood  cholesterol  measured  before  and  after  the  six-week  period  
     The  researchers  said  this  would  make  their  findings  more  accurate  
     Several  studies  have  found  garlic  pills  can  lower  blood  pressure  and  blood  cholesterol  
     But  the  Oxford  team  disputed  these  findings  and  said  either  previous  trials  may  have  been  interpreted  incorrectly ,  those  taking  part  were  not  given  special  diets  beforehand  or  the  duration  of  the  studies  may  have  been  too  short  
     The  six-month  trial  was  funded  by  the  British  Heart  Foundation  and  Lichtwer  Pharma  GmbH ,  which  makes  Kwai  brand  garlic  tablets  
     The  study  did  not  address  whether  whole  garlic  could  affect  cholesterol

     The  volcano  in  the  Soufriere  hills  has  erupted  three  times  in  the  past  13  months  and  last  April  some  4,500  people  living  in  the  capital ,  Plymouth ,  and  southern  areas  were  evacuated  to  the  north ,  where  many  are  living  in  public  shelters  and  schools

     Sampras  opens  the  defence  of  his  U.S.  Open  crown  against  David  Rikl  of  the  Czech  Republic ,  while  top-ranked  Graf  begins  her  title  defence  against  Yayuk  Basuki  of  Indonesia  
     Wednesday  's  U.S.  Open  draw  ceremony  revealed  that  both  title  holders  should  run  into  their  first  serious  opposition  in  the  third  round  
     Looming  in  Sampras  's  future  is  a  likely  third-round  date  with  recent  nemesis  Mark  Philippoussis ,  the  rising  Australian  who  took  out  Sampras  in  the  third  round  of  the  Australian  Open  in  January  
     Sampras  avenged  that  defeat  with  a  straight  sets  win  over  the  19-year-old  power  hitter  in  the  second  round  at  Wimbledon  and  their  rubber  match  in  New  York  could  provide  some  first-week  fireworks  
     While  only  a  stunning  upset  will  keep  Graf  from  sailing  through  to  a  predictable  semifinal  showdown  with  third  seed  Arantxa  Sanchez  Vicario ,  the  German  star  could  also  be  tested  in  the  third  round  where  she  will  probably  face  28th-ranked  veteran  Natasha  Zvereva  of  Belarus  
     There  will  be  no  repeat  of  last  year  's  men  's  final  with  eighth-ranked  Andre  Agassi  landing  in  Sampras  's  half  of  the  draw  
     Bumping  Agassi  up  to  the  sixth  seeding  avoided  the  possibility  that  he  would  run  into  Sampras  as  early  as  the  quarter-finals ,  but  they  could  lock  horns  in  the  semis
