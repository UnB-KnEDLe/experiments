You
know
what
?

The
school
is
going
to
be
closed
for
the
rest
of
the
week
Anderson
.

Well
,
actually
,
regarding
,
um
,
Koizumi
's
attendance
at
this
APEC
summit
,
people
are
more
interested
in
the
relations
between
Japan
and
its
Asian
neighboring
countries
,
including
the
kind
of
alliance
relationship
between
the
US
and
Japan
,
and
so
on
.

I
bought
one
of

We
wo

and
you
are
suggesting
this

He
does
n't
seem
to
be
backing
away
from
those
controversial
comments
the
last
throes
of
the
insurgency
.

Last
year
,
Dentsu
's
foreign
business
accounted
for
less
than
10
%
of
total
billings
,
but
the
company
is
aiming
at
20
%
in
the
near
future
.

The
leaks
to
The
New
York
Times
and
the
publishing
of
those
leaks
is
very
damaging
.

In
late
New
York
trading
yesterday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8340
marks
,
up
from
1.8300
marks
late
Friday
,
and
at
141.90
yen
,
up
from
141.65
yen
late
Friday
.

Something
about
the
background
check
.

The
man
showed
Elisha
the
place
where
the
ax
head
fell
.

The
story
describes
an
unexpected
conflict
that
arises
out
of
a
misunderstanding
between
a
child
and
a
grandfather
who
care
deeply
for
one
another
.

``
With
Krenz
,
we
just
do
n't
know
what
to
expect

But
even
a
wildlife
expert
like
Hannah
was
surprised
to
find
such
a
mighty
creature
submerged
in
lake
water
.

The
number
of
experimental
cities
involved
in
optimizing
capital
structure
increased
from
58
to
111
;
key
enterprises
on
which
the
state
placed
extra
emphasis
increased
from
300
to
512
and
experimental
surveys
of
the
enterprise
group
increased
from
57
to
120
.

We
also
saw
the
American
diplomat
Willie
Montgomery
who
arrived
in
Belgrade
today
to
set
up
most
probably
a
meeting
between
a
senior
U.S.
official
James
O'brien
,
who
is
coming
to
Belgrade
.

Alusuisse

Any
political
offensive
humor
is
automatically
--

Consolidated
Papers
Inc.
said
it
plans
to
spend
$
495
million
on
new
paper
-
manufacturing
equipment
and
facilities
.

Er
,
he
himself
thought
,
er
,
that
he
was
probably
,,
er
,
200
%
correct
in
what
he
has
been
doing
.

You
could
just
really
feel
you
're
working
the
backs
of
your
legs
.

Buried
in
the
glossy
hardbound
catalog
for
the
sale
,
however
,
appears
the
statement
,
``
Sotheby
's
has
an
interest
in
the
property
in
this
catalog
.

Designer
Sandra
Garratt
filed
for
Chapter

Bankruptcy
Code
protection
,
saying
that
her
cash
flow
had
been
cut
off
.

Well
actually
I
may
be
two
or
three
miles
closer
.

That
's
because
all
the
things
reported
by
al
-
Jazeera
TV
station
since
its
establishment
in
1996
were
those
the
US
did
not
want
viewers
in
the
world
to
look
at
,
especially
with
respect
to
the
Afghan
war
and
Iraq
war
.

God
will
do
what
is
right
.

I
am
sure
of
this
,
so
I
know
that
I
will
stay
here
and
be
with
you
to
help
you
grow
and
have
joy
in
your
faith
.
