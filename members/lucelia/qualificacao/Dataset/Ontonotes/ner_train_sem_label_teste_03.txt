In

out
at

,
exiled
ANC
President
Oliver
Tambo

who
ca
n't
legally

To

it
's
a
proud
thing
to
be

and
after
you
wash
their

you
rinse
it
with
that

But
I
feel
that
if
somebody
does
n't
get
up
and
start
talking
about
this
now
,
the
next
time
around
,
when
we
have
the
next
iteration
of
these
programs
,
it
will
still
be
true
that
everyone
is
scared
to
talk
about
it

and
we
should
not
underestimate
their
improvement
.

And

this

Then
the
President
leads
an
attack
on
the
media
.

Rep.
Hamilton
said
the
bill
will
be
modified
substantially
to
call
for
two
meetings
each
year
between
the
Fed
's
open
market
committee
and
the
Treasury
Secretary
,
the
chairman
of
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
and
the
director
of
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
.

The
weaker
he
gets
,
the
more
he
turns
toward
the
U.S.

help
.

Debate
on
the
legislation
,
which
faces
a
veto
threat
from
President
Bush
,
is
to
continue
today
.

Most
of
the
allegations
no
longer
pending
were
ethics
charges
withdrawn
by
state
prosecutors
as
part
of
a
pre-trial
agreement
.

Really
,
what
did
you
expect
to
see
?

Oh
yes
they
are
.

Even
if
missile
defense
could
be
99
%
effective
,
and
only
one
percent
of
attacking
missiles
got
through
,
the
situation
could
still
be
a
total
loss
.

and
that
was
a
bit
of
fun

The
Lord

This

that

Richard

According

Analysts
viewed
the

comments
as
an
indication
that
the
central
bank
is
disinclined
to
ease

policy
further

And
since
the
American
orientation
so
far
has
not
been
completely
elaborated
,
especially
after

the
Baker

Hamilton
report
,
in
my
estimation
,
the
situation
in
Lebanon
will
remain
pending
the
clarification
of
perceptions
that
the
American
administration
wants
to
adopt

the

Maybe
he

The
exposure
of
this
incident
at
one
point
placed
the
Berlusconi
government
in

embarrassing
situation

the
most
senior
Israeli
official

office

People
found
Sun

singing
voice
fresh

it

when
they
throw
up
it
smells
disgusting

here
's
the
president
talking
about
how
he
hopes
to
deal
with
this

This
will
bring

and
the

I
was
able

stand
proudly
before

and
proclaim
that
the

completely
consistent
with
what
they

in

When
you
try
to
get
people
to
invest
in
a
new
venture
,
there
will
invariably
be
one
question
that
each
and
every
one
of
those
potential
investors
will
have
in
mind
:

Therefore
,
we
should
say
that
it
is
,
right

this
Prime

has

ruined

let
's
keep
in

first
of
all
keeping
Republican
majority

not
the
top
priority
for
this
White

.

The
UAA
holds
a
"
Celebrating
Oriental
New
Year
"
event
at
this
time
every
year
as
a
way
of
encouraging
cultural
interchange
,
but
every
year
it
is
a
struggle
to
find
co-sponsors
willing
to
provide
funding
.

And
the
head
of
Christ
is
God
.

Yet
it
is
hard
to
pin
down
exactly
where
that
position
is
.

An
editorial
titled
"
The
Standing
Committee
of
the
National
People
's
Congress
has
made
an
important
decision
for
Hong
Kong
"
in
the
"
Dagong
Newspaper
"
today
,
believed
that
the
decision
granted
the
people
of
Hong
Kong
a
legal
basis
to
make
sure
that
the
first
legislative
assembly
and
regional
organizations
of
the
Special
Administrative
Region
would
emerge
smoothly
,
most
patriotic
compatriots
who
love
Hong
Kong
would
receive
encouragement
from
this
decision
,
would
actively
participate
in
social
affairs
as
heroes
,
and
would
make
preparations
for
realizing
a

in

The
women
of
Shanghai
are
well
known

it

to
handle
their
business
and

wisely

Then
Nathanael
said
,
``

This

This
morning
,
only
Chen
Guangfu
,
Chen
Guangcheng
's
eldest
brother
,
went
into
the
court
to
attend
the
reading
of
the
verdict
.

Right.

Neither
one
managed
to
ignite
the
hopes
and
dreams
of
Americans
.

The
wounds
from
the
1987
crash
have
n't
yet
healed
,
and
not
all
claims
against
the
exchange
clearinghouse
--
by
those
who
bet
the
Hang
Seng
index

fall
--
have
been
settled

Buildings
owned

Their
discomfort
is
a
healthy
sign
for
the
rest
of

So
we
have
to
be
on
very
good

Syria

continue

Attracting
foreign
investment
has
become
an
effective
method
in
relieving
employment
pressure
for
this
country
who
has
the
largest
population
in
the
world
.

He
was
still
angry
with
them
for
everything
that
Manasseh
had
done
.

He
ruled
three
months
in
Jerusalem
.

Are
n't
we
,
after
all
,
the
inevitable
culmination
of
that
stately
pageant
called
evolution
?

This
struggle
has
brought
the
fitness
market
to
a
fever
pitch
,
and
also
is
sparking
new
and
diversified
ideas
about
health
in
Taiwan
.

Taipei
's
wealth
and
high
status
as
the
capital
have
long
been
a
sore
spot
with
many
people
living
elsewhere
in
Taiwan
.

OK.

and
it
sticks
out
in

big
circle

Her
dismissal
angered
many

to
write
an

here

just
the

is
provocative

acting

If

they

When

,
for

,
in

yes
there
also

appointed
by

therefore
there
also
,
the

of
the

As

what
measures

I
personally
understand
that
the
significance

Yes

the

I
ask

the

In

it

I
just
feel
a

a

but
anyone
that
thinks
any
of
this
is
going
to
be
solved
,
by
whatever
means
,
without
lots
and
lots
of
money
needs
to
go
Back
to
square
one
.

Much
of
the
jockeying
by
OTC
traders
and
investors
centered
on
shares
of
companies
that
might
be
financially
affected
by
damage
from
the
devastating
earthquake
in
northern
California
.

and
then
in
January
we
went
to
this
resort
just
across
the
island

That
's
about
half
the
price
of
comparably
equipped
IBM
mainframes
.

What
I
have
experienced
myself
or
,
even
more
,
what
I
have
seen
are
the
countless
who
have
given
up
their
studies
year
by
year
,
those
with
wrecked
health
everywhere
,
those
who
sold
their
souls
and
even
those
who
lost
their
lives
.

One
would
force
brokerage
houses
to
provide
the
SEC
detailed
information
about
loans
made
by
their
holding
companies
.

Really
screaming

I
have
had
contact
with
many
Japanese
.

Interestingly
,
even
as
such
"
pro-active
defense
"
ideas
are
being
proposed
,
the
Ministry
of
National
Defense
MND
has
made
a
seemingly
contrary
move
:
It
has
announced
that
military
forces
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
remote
offshore
Pratas
and
Spratley
islands
,
and
that
responsibility
for
these
islands
and
for
coastal
patrolling
will
be
transferred
to
the
Coast
Guard
.

It
's
been
a
rough
couple
months
.

That
they
retain
Korean
citizenship
and
ties
is
a
reflection
of
history
--
their
parents
were
shipped
in
as
laborers
during
the
decades
when
Japan
occupied
Korea
before
World
War
II
--
and
the
discrimination
that
still
faces
Koreans
in
Japanese
society
.

You
are
looking
at
us
as
if
it
was
our
power
that
made
this
man
walk
.

Aside
from
working
with
Mr.
Robinson
on
the
American
Express
advertising
account
for
about
11
years
,
Mr.
Roman
serves
on
several
of
the
same
charities
and
boards
as
Mr.
Robinson
.

Suppose
someone
comes
into
your
meeting
wearing
very
nice
clothes
and
a
gold
ring
.

He
prayed
that
it
would
not
rain
.

He
and
our
other
ancestors
lived
there
until
they
died
.

But
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
fell
for
the
seventh
-
consecutive
session
as
more
investors
dumped
UAL
shares
.

A
further
decline
in
prices
will
lead
to
mine
production
cuts
in
the
U.S.
,
he
says
.

The
process
dramatically
increased
our
average
life
expectancy
,
eliminated
much
pain
and
constantly
improved
health
and
well
-
being
.

Even
if
they
do
something
wrong
to
you
seven
times
in
one
day
,
but
they
say
they
are
sorry
each
time
,
you
should
forgive
them
.

The

of
Robert
Rauschenberg
's

convinced
me

Um
,
and
at
each
village
,
I
would
go
around
trying
to
find
out
who
had
the
most
technology
awareness
.

District
police
in
1983
descended
on
his
suburban
home
,
which
he
and
his
large
family
used
as
both
residence
and
factory
,
and
demanded
proof
the
house
and
equipment
were
his
.

The
base
rate
on
corporate
loans
at
large
U.S.
money
center
commercial
banks
.

This
problem
,
from
the
time
of
the
case
we
have
handled
,
um
,
is
mainly
that
they
hang
fake
military
license
plates
.

Although
these
were
all
successful
singers
,
they
comprised
a
small
group
.

I
think
John
McCain
's
running
for
president
in
the
Republican
Party
.

The

We
think
that

is
unfortunate

not
unexpected

In

be
among

.

The
bowls
were
filled
with
the
anger
of
God
,
who
lives
forever
and
ever
.

The
answer
will
be
obvious
.

and
then
Right.

As
many
economists

businessmen
see
it
,
those
incongruities
underscore
a
paradox
that
seems
likely
to
bedevil
the
economy
throughout
the

inflation

With

to
the
development

the

In

it

If
they
put
a
Republican
into
office
,
not
only
will
they
acquire
less
in
terms
of
local
benefits
but
their
selected
legislator
will
be
relatively
powerless
to
prevent
other
legislators
from
``
bringing
home
the
bacon
''
to
their
respective
constituencies
.

Nevertheless
,
the
increasing

that
these

be
resolved
weighed
on

The

?

You

His
strength
lies
in
his

Just
I
have
n't
been
home
much
this
summer

So
Jesus
called
them
together
and
talked
to
them
using
some
stories
.

He
launched
into
Saint
-
Saens
's
``
The
Swan
''
from
``
Carnival
of
the
Animals
,
''
a
favorite
encore
piece
for
cellists
,
with
lovely
,
glossy
tone
and
no

so
we
went
up
there
and
spent
almost
a

The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
``
American
Way
of
Buying
''
survey
this
year
found
that
most
consumers
switch
brands
for
many
of
the
products
they
use
.

The
odds
are
against
any
man
even
one
like
Tookie
Williams
who
was
nominated
for
a
Nobel
Peace
prize
.

Eh
,
as
far
as
Koizumi
himself
is
concerned
,
what
is
his
problem
?

The
court
will
hear
more
arguments
on
that
,
Monday
.

And
this
patience
is
proof
that
we
are
strong
.

um
and
I
had
been
misdiagnosed
or
sort
of
half
diagnosed
with
depression
years
before
.

Such
is
the
case
with
veteran
actor
Shih
Ying
,
who
is
now
featured
in
the
CTS
series
First
Family
.

This
has
raised
the
hackles
of
Lung
Ying
-
tai
,
the
director
of
the
Taipei
Bureau
of
Culture
:
"
The
new
government
can
not
try
to
lock
up
the
nation
.

With
so
much
said
,
now
we
can
start
analyzing
the
questions
concerning
the
collapse
of
the
school
buildings
and
public
buildings
.

At
the
very
least
,
a
recession
would
prompt
investors
to
buy
the
highest
-
quality
bonds
they
can
find
--
that
is
,
Treasurys
.

But
Mr.
Simonds
-
Gooding
said
he
is
n't
talking
to
any
studios
about
investing
.

Reaching
for
that
extra
bit
of
yield
can
be
a
big
mistake
--
especially
if
you
do
n't
understand
what
you
're
investing
in
.

Sorting
out
the
wreckage
is
expected
to
take
several
days
.

We
just
stayed
at
George
Miranza
's
.

So
Jesus
went
with
them
.

When
he
came
to
Rome
,
he
looked
and
looked
for
me
until
he
found

``

a

One
extreme
case
is
a
professor

:
who
originally
graduated
from
our
department
;
you
could
say
she
's
one

workers
,
the
quality
of
the
things
she
does
is
extremely
high

and
most
people
do
n't
attain
the
difficulty
of
her
work

A
budget
that
reflected
the
real
costs
of
lending
would
eliminate
incentives
to
convert
spending
or
lending
programs
to
guarantees
and
would
let
taxpayers
know
what
Congress
is
committing
them
to
.

Brothers
and
sisters

I
want
you
to
know
that
the
Good

message
I

He
said

stability
of

was
the
basic
guarantee
for
the
prosperity
and
stability
of
Macao

We

And
you
will
be
given
a
very
great
welcome
into
the
kingdom
of
our
Lord
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
,
a
kingdom
that
never
ends

``
There
was
a
general
feeling
that
we
'd
seen
the
worst
,
''
said
Patrick
Foley
,
deputy
chief
economic
adviser
for
Lloyds
Bank
in
London
.

Then
King
Solomon
sent
some
men
to
get
Adonijah
and
brought
him
in.

He
said
the
Son
of
Man
must
be
handed
over
to
the
control
of
sinful
men
,
be
killed
on
a
cross
,
and
rise
from
death
on
the
third

.
''

Of
course
,
different
countries
are
in
different
situations
,
and
the
external
threats
faced
by
these
countries
are
not
comparable
to
the
cross-strait
situation
.

the
people
have
very
good
impression
of
us
down
here

Another
problem
of
course
is
that
he
told
the
Daily
News
reporter
that
he
hardly
even
remembered
Imette
being
there
and
now
he
's
saying
oh
yeah
I
walked
her
out
.

However
,
perhaps
due
to
his
familiarity
with
what
was
best
in
Chinese
art
,
Wang
did
n't
take
this
interest
in
Western
art
any
further
.

But
I
see
another
law
working
in
my
body
.

Dress
for
success
?

They
do
n't
work
or
make
clothes
for
themselves
.

You
carefully
study
the
Scriptures
.

He
does
add
,
however
,
that
transplanted
Japanese
car
makers
are
boosting
the
levels
of
U.S.
-
made
steel
in
their
autos
,
instead
of
relying
heavily
on
imported
steel
.

Well
,
currently
Japan
is
very
important
to
Russia
again
.

Then
if
I
come
and
visit
you
or
if
I
am
away
from
you
,
I
will
hear
good
things
about
you

In

This

tracing

No

I

I

Not

In
the

quietly

inexorably
reshaping

At

While
the
State

positions
itself

it

role

Mr.

Who
is
there
and
what
kind
of
assistance
are
they
offering
or
what
is
the
symbolic
value
of
their

I

You

I
did

He
was
able
to
use
his

,
and
he
began
to

And
uh
I
think

essentially
had
it
correctly

They

and
both

normally

Was

Since
Japan
is
an

,
sea
transport
is
its

,
so
the
decisive
field
of

was
the

No

I

Congratulating
herself

,
could
double
in
price
by
the
time
his
talks
with
Mr.

are
completed
later
this

.

But
Tim
I
think
speculating
about
how
we
might
uh
set
up
military
action
is
n't
helpful
at
a
time
when
we
really
are
concentrating
on
the
diplomacy

--
Global
reciprocity

I
trust
in
the
Lord
that
you
will
not

those

The

Mr.

Loyalty

A

Then

Currently

the

The

aroused
a
debate
on
the
Internet

I
'm
telling
you
it
's
hormonal
.

Since
stock
futures
were
created
in
1982
,

on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
and

where
trading
in
stock

index

rivals
that
in
the

themselves

He
killed
the
priests
on
those
altars
and
burned
men
's
bones
on
the
altars
so
that
they
could
never
be
used
again
.

Shorted
shares
must
eventually
be
replaced
through
buying
.

I
do

if
they

Kidder

unit

announced
it

and
Merrill

pulled
out
of

When

To
an
unusual
degree
,
the
massive

become

The
word
is
integrity
.

They
cut
into
the
fat
of
strong

The
result
was
pleasing
to
the
audience
,
who
liked
the
taste
of
the
Iraqi
tea

the

approach

Some

The
jurisdiction
of
the
MJIB
,
for
one
thing
,
must
be
clarified
.

That
is
,
whether
it
should
be
economic
cooperation
first
or
resolution
of
political
issues
first
.

Most

Everybody

It

Putin

visit
to
Japan
after
an
interval
of
five

was
realized
following
quite
a
few
twists

Equally
inconceivable

that
the
ANC

,
to

of
the
world

most
thankless
political

:
trying

drag

said
to

,
``
Tell

In
this
way
we
can
make
our

for

ahead
,
setting

And
I
hit

And
those
are

The

If

the

are
still
the
same
old
"
outlaws
"
that
they
ever
were

and
he
is
not
alone
.

As
the
political
tempo
quickens
in
Israel
,
so
the
violence
continues
in

When

we

independence
,
the
normally

cautious

Mr.

What
kinds
of
challenges
face
the
next
leader
of
Taiwan
?

Well
,
to
accelerate
solutions
to
our
many
problems
.

Although
constructing
a
missile
system
is
a
main
focus
of
defense
thinking
in
Taiwan
,
effective
use
of
high
-
tech
weaponry
depends
on
the
quality
of
military
personnel
and
,
moreover
,
can
not
be
seen
as
a
panacea
for
all
defense
problems
.

In
middle
age
,
you
kiss
girls
on
the
forehead
,
not
the
lips
.

I
have
communicated
this
decision
with
these
counties
in
letters
detailing
the
criteria
I
used
in
making
my
judgments
,
and
the
application
of
these
criteria
to
the

circumstances
,
and
copies
of
these

Be

mm
was
very
happy
to
come
to

but
I
am
rather
shy
so
my
cousin
says

Lin
Ching

yun
,
who
often

that

their

the
bags
under

removed
before
they
go
for

In
my
mind
I
compare
to
some
of
the
federal
agents
who
were
uh
injured
or
involved
in
Hurricane
Andrew
a
few
years
ago
.

Um

The
measure

the

of

and
medicine
to
Cuba
for
the
first
time
in
40
years
.

The
case
,
it
can
be
said
,
brings
together
a
lot
of
the
defects
of
China
's
judiciary
,
such
as
the
lack
of
the
"
principle
on
prohibiting
double
jeopardy
,
"
the
difficulty
in
getting
compensation
from
the
state
,
and
the
detrimental
practice
the
political
and
law
committees
have
of
coordinating
cases
.

Well
,
when
this
sort
of
thing
happens
in
a
small
community
and
I
guess
that
's
a
under
statement
in
this
case
,
whether
or
not
it
all
succeeds
depends
on
how
well
some
of
the
local
people
can
keep
secrets
.

As
Iraq
does
n't
evade
it

and
the
US
can
not
block
it
,
this
is
enough
to
show
that
those

actually
found
peace

And
with
a

more

I
spouted

When

The

He
asked

In
her
first

interview
following
Mr.

Mrs.

reiterated
her
desire

And
the

which
made

left
many
people
wondering
who
this

So
we
submitted

to
the
minister
of
the
interior
a
copy
of
the
letter
is
attached
in
the
letters

in
which
we
explained
that
the
decision
of
dismissal
violates
the
system

justice
,
and
the
truth
since
my
alleged
incompetence
during
the
period

was
answered

refuted
by
the

I
received
the

Now
some

If

My
sense
is
that
this
is
ultimately
going
to
come
down
to
the
question
is
the
senate
going
to
confirm
someone
who
is
going
to
be
a
reliable

probably
be
voting
consistently

Worst
strategy
:

out

Rather
,
this

requires
the
creation

still
having
the

running

to
confirm
each

worst

even

These
people
have
already
been
judged
guilty

When
the
response
to
criticism
is
only
a
better
explanation
of
policies
without
altering
the
reasons
for
the
criticism
,
I
am
convinced
that
Mr.
Kageyama
has
still
failed
to
attack
the
root
cause

the
problem

is
simply
treating

This
is

this

the
second
bans
cooperatives
from
buying

off

Their
violation
of

said
that
the
undertaking

that
the

It
's
just
not
an
option
,
you
know

and
I
said
well
is
this
somebody
that
contacted
you
on
your
email
or
what
?

But
you
ask
,
'
Who
touched
me
?
'

First
of
all
did
you
like
the
book
?

``
For
many

,
buying
a

car
is
a

foreign
experience

So
it
would
be
better
to
come
in
on
,
like
the
morning
of
the
ninth
or
like
before
noon
on
the
ninth
?

Among
them
,
he
says
,
is
the
family
's
traditional
ties
to
old
wealth
and
decision
-
makers
in
banking
and
industry
throughout
Europe
and
beyond
.

Worse
,
they
are
often
unable
even
to
identify
the
cause
.

Huang
is
never
derisive
or
critical
of
his
elderly

It
involves
a
reallocation

After

came
back

Another
point
they
agree
on
is
that
not
enough
was
done
in
the
past
to
develop
ties
between
Taiwan
and
Macau
,
but
that
with
Macau
's
change
of
status
,
and
the
corresponding
change
in
atmosphere
,
things
should
be
different
from
now
on
.

A
Compaq
Computer
Corp.
spokeswoman
said
that
the
company
has
n't
made
a
decision
yet

although
``
it

n't
under
active
consideration
.

Four
other

That
's
right

To
be
sure
,
the
full
Senate
,
facing
a
fast
-
approaching
budget
deadline
,
last
Friday
stripped
away
all
of
the
tax
breaks
that
were
contained
in
the
Finance
Committee
bill
.

I
have
been
talking
like
a
fool
,
but
you
made
me
do
it
.

I
would
like
to
know
the
primary
goal
that
you
perceived
when
you
decided
to
proceed
with
this
initiative
.

But
Gao
feels
that
literature
is
above
politics
and
should
not
serve
it
.

and
%um
she
's
healthy
again
.

She
says
it
happens
all
the
time
and
that
she
loses
money
because
they
do
n't
have
enough
coins
to
make
change
.

So
experts
say
it
's
too
soon
to
tell
if
it
works
,
and
some
call
Gore
's
plan
an
empty
promise
.

But
here
's
the
catch

''
Mr.
Lorenzo
told
reporters
.

There
's
a
certain
cruel
logic
at
work
here
:
It
's
particularly
appropriate
--
and
tragic
--
that
the
land
that
produced
Karl
Marx
should
prove
socialism
's
failure
in
an
experiment
that
uses
its
own
people
as
controls
.

I
do
n't
want
to
go
there
.

Hsu

points
out

and

His

Do
you

Tmac
gets
the

so
he

Three
hundred

twenty

two

are

Fiji
archipelago

in
the
southern
Pacific

all
holding
their
breaths
for
how
things
will
end
between
the
army
and
the
government
.

But
Jesus
answered
,
``
I
have
food
to
eat
that

The
Marina
also
has
become
the
focal

become
lost
during

The
harder
he
tried
to
push
them
into
large
piles
,
the
closer
he
came
to
breaking
the
rake
and
straining

back
.

This
would
then
naturally
solve
the
problem
of

The
sell

off
in
New

I
do

Any

they
say
,
should
be
well
thought

and
executed
gradually
,
during
market
rallies

Then
the
master
will
punish
that
servant
and

In

tax
increases

I
mean
those
who
have

asked

about
what
he

told

So

The

on
the
contrary
,
it
had
increased
its
investments
in
a
number
of
companies
,
and
in
addition
did
not
enter
into
any
speculation
at
all
but
is
working
on
buying
and
keeping

Things
never
change

A

so

Remember
that
the

give
everyone
a

for

Though

He
knew
which
local
luminaries
had
been
caught
driving
drunk
,
which
had
been
found
with
their
mistresses
.

And
that
Son
,
made
perfect
through
suffering
,
will
serve
forever
.

He
did
many
bad
things
,
just
as
the
people
from
Ahab
's
family
had
done
.

It
has
gotten
a
bad
rep
because
its
once
heavily
polluted
Cuyahoga
River
caught
fire
,
because
former
Mayor
Ralph
Perk
set
his
hair
on
fire
with
an
acetylene
torch
and
because
its
proposed
Rock
'n'
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
was
recently
refused
an
urban

development
grant
.

Though
the
split
has
long
been
expected
,
the
exchanges
are
n't
fully
prepared
to
go
their
separate
ways
.

and
we
need
to
just
get
as
informed
as
we
can
about
what
other
things
might
help
us
live
healthy
lives
.

Some
citizenship
classes
are
also
forced
to
update
their
existing

.

Shandong
is
currently
the
first

implement
the
policy

The

involves
the
sale
of
about
35

I
try
to
describe
all
that
to
people

So
the

got
up
then
and
went
back
to
Jerusalem
.

Finally
he
threw
them
away
and
removed
them
from

.

Not
only
do
they
feel
that
they
have
never
had
an
opportunity
for
equal
dialogue
with
the
government
,
but
also
that
the
fishing
grounds
on
which
local
fishermen
have
relied
for
generations
will
soon
be
threatened
with
major
environmental
degradation
.

When

they
saw
him

I
have
always
taken
pride
in

but
from
the
moment
I

I
will
put

He
explained
that

must
remain

He
did

go
as
far
as
he
could
have

indeed
he
combined
them
with

and
as
I
've
indicated
I
've
already
talked
to
the

good

,
more
important

false

that
undermine
what

for
the
most

a
lively
account
of
a
life
already
familiar
from
earlier
works
.

Not

you

I
think
that
the
problem
here
that
we
've
had
right
from
the
beginning
is
overly
optimistic
predictions
on
the
part
of
what
would
happen

But
you

That
produced

And
just
to
be
clear
,
--what
kind
of
facility
was
it
that
you
arrested
him
at
?

The

:
``
I
only
asked

As
it
was
,
despite
his
business
conquests
,

missed
an
even
greater
prize

So
now
,
why
are
you
putting
a
heavy
burden
around
the
necks
of
the
non-Jewish
followers
?

It
can
also
affect
the

confidence

We
show
that
we

The
meeting
was
chaired
by
government
delegations
of
the
6
aforementioned
countries
and
representatives
of
some
international
organizations
and

The
statement
came
after
members
of

refused
to
call

How
much
is
that

Yes

somewhere
in

Scriptures

talked
about
the
seventh
day
of

I
watched

this

when

hullabaloo
surrounding

died
,
so

did

interest

Hundreds
of
people
lined
up
every
day
at
the
Colgate

Palmolive
Co.
stand
to
receive
a
free
tube
of
toothpaste
,
a
commodity
in
chronically
short
supply
here
.

And
it
would
shift
the
burden
to
prosecutors
to
disprove
that
discrimination
caused
any
statistical
racial
disparities
.

so
I
just
conducted
the
band
.

It
could
point
to
plenty
of
ailments
that
the
Spanish
economic
rejuvenation
so
far
has
failed
to
cure

Just
last
week
the
investigation
hit
a
stumbling
block
,
when
five
Indonesian
policemen
refused
to
appear
for
questioning
as
witnesses
at
the
Attorney
General
's
office
.

Separate
but
close

It
was
something

Simon

Israeli

leaders
have
spoken
by
telephone
in
a
new
effort
to
try
to
stem
the
ongoing
violence
in
the
Middle
East
.

What
is
worrisome
is
that
the
President
will
be
with
extreme
powers
and
he
will
be
almost
like
a
king
,
able
to
decide
whatever
he
wants
.

But
Mrs.
Boehm
did
n't
mention
any
of
them
.

Basically
you
're
saying
look
we
took
action
.

He
got
a
sense
of
his
soul
found
him
to
be
very
straightforward
and
very
trustworthy
.

May
God
grant
success
to
you
and
to
everyone
else
who
are
earnestly
concerned
about
what
He
loves
and
approves
of

Although
Section
2
of
the
act
expressly
disclaims
requiring
that
minorities
win
a
proportional
share
of
elective
offices
,
few
municipal
and
state
government
plans
achieve
preclearance
by
the
Justice
Department
or
survive
the
scrutiny
of
the
lower
federal
courts
unless
they
carve
out
as
many
solidly
minority
districts
as
possible
.

But
be
like

Lord
Jesus

so
that
when
people
see
what
you
do
,
they
will
see

ask

nothing

Listen
to
what

Bob
Dougherty
said
to
our
Miles
O'Brien
on

about
the
possibility
of

rescue
emergency
vehicle
being
required
.

He
pointed
out
that
in
some
European
industrial
countries
current
economy
lagging
is
mainly
due
to
structural
obstacles
such
as
over
-
burdened
social
welfare
systems
and
the
ossification
of
labor
markets
that
have
been
existing
for

mean
,
uh
,
at

what
you
presented
in

uh
,
takes
us
towards

takes
us
back
to
pessimism
,
of
questions
you
put
forward
at
the

your
introduction

I
think
,
uh
,
this
represents
the
essence
of
what

the

now

Suddenly
there

FERC
's
regulation
had
given
pipelines
until
March
31
,
1989
,
to
pass
on
to
customers
as
much
as
50
%
of
the
costs
of
buying
out
their
broken
contracts
,
which
were
made
with
producers
when
gas
prices
were
high
and
supplies
short
.

That
means
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
was
running
closer
to
$
75
billion
than
to
$
95
billion
in
1988
,
and
$
55
billion
annualized
rather
than
$
80
billion
in
the
first
quarter
of
1989
.

It
should
continue
as
we
work

Here
this

is

yet
he
has
been
spending
so
much
time
and
effort
on
our
behalf
.

You
will
leave
the

The

Even
staunch
anti-bike
Sierra

concede
that
10

cause
most
of
the
problems
.

I
am
pleased
that
both
the
House
and
Senate
have
passed
budget
resolutions
that
show
real
spending
restraint
,
and
now
the
Congress
must
focus
on
a
robust
and
effective
growth
package
.

They
should
be
focused
on
the
double
standard

pleaded

It

is
rather
the
integral

player
within

It
is

the

gone

the
situation
well
.

No
,
they
were
not
.

The
fourth
Television
News
Seminar
for
Friendly
Nations
,
sponsored
by
the
Government
Information
Office
,
began
just
after
the
lunar
new
year
.

But
as
Wang
Hao
-
wei
sees
it
,
the
deeper
cause
of
the
current
worship
of
ever
-
greater
youthfulness
in
modern
society
can
be
traced
to
the
dissolution
of
the
traditional
family
structure
.

But
the
proof
of
my
teaching
was
the
power
that
the
Spirit
gives
.

The
ground
along
the
Embarcadero
the
street
that
skirts
the
city
's
eastern
boundary
and
piers
--
dropped
six
inches
after
the
quake
,
wreaking
major
damage
to
at
least
one
of
the
piers
.

It
could
be
arrogance
or
factors
of
being
a
powerful
woman
and
the
celebrity
--

At
first
,
ah
,
she
sold
animations
of
characters
that
she
had
designed
to
players
in
the
game
.

At
least
once
Mancuso
's
boss
yells
``
In
here
--
now
,
''
and
proceeds
to
dress
his
investigator
down
:

I
could
only
find
a
Sheraton
in
Pleasant
about
25
miles
from
the

Actually
I
've
known
for
a
long
time
that
by
their
so
-
called
accepting
complaints
,
the
radio
station
is
intentionally
collecting
unfavorable
and
negative
things
for
public
release
.

I
was
able
to
transition
from
one
exercise
to
another
very
seamlessly
.

After
the
men
brought
the
lifeboat
in
,
they
tied
ropes
around
the
ship
to
hold
it
together
.

In
light
of
the
recent
skittishness
in
the
high
-
yield
market
,
junk
bond
analysts
and
traders
expect
other
high
-
yield
deals
to
be
sweetened
or
restructured
before
they
are
offered
to
investors
.

All
people
will
hate
you
because
you
follow
me
.

Then
the
church
will
not
have
that
burden
and
will
be
able
to
care
for
the
widows
who
have
no
one
else
to
help
them
.

The
people
with

The
issue
:
Is

based

I

actually

it
shows
that
a
series
of
issues
such
as
his
visit
to

have
indeed
cast
a
very
heavy
shadow
over
the

One
of
the
documents
entitled
"
A
contingency
plan
for
Brazil
"
was
drafted
with
the
help
of
the
then
US
Ambassador
in
Brazil
Gordon
.

When
people
accept
something
like
that
,
they
show
they
are
waiting
for
a
country
that
will
be
their
own

in

The
most
important
one
is
this
:
God
trusted
the
Jews
with
his
teachings
.

What
they
reported
was
entirely
incompatible
with
the
so
-
called
freedom
of
the
press
advocated
by
the
US
.

Then
,
using
a
new
technique
called
homologous
recombination
for
introducing
genes
into

,
they
transferred
all

related

He
said
that
his

have
been
a
tribute
to

My
greatest
regret
would
probably
be
um
the
fact
that
I
put
this
young
man
through
this
.

As
David
it
is
an
active

crime
scene

you

I
drove
up

So
,
we
figured
our
plan
,

But
the
hardest
part
was
getting
there
.

there
are
so
many
factors
who
are
playing
in
this
process
.

``
It
's
hard
to
see
how
an
investment
by
the
largest
cable
operator
in
the
weaker
of
the
two
networks
is
anti-competitive
,
when
the
stronger
of
the
two
networks
is
owned
by
the
second
largest

cable
operator

Mr.
Kern
said

so
where
was

The
project
management
system
of
the
Three
Gorges
project
will
introduce
scientific
management
methods
and
advanced
computer
technology
of
the
MAI
Corp.
of
Canada
,
which
uses
the
project
database
management
system
as
the
core
component
in
its
control
and
management
of
the
whole
process
of
designing
,
planning
,
contracting
,
financing
,
goods
and
materials
,
equipment
,
construction
and
installation
of
each
subproject
of
the
Three
Gorges
project
.

I
mean
everything
was
the
Orioles
you
know

Qizhen
Zhu
said
that
the
Chinese
people
are
full
of
confidence
in
following
along
the
road
they
chose
,
and
steadily
marching
forward
,
gradually
realizing
the
already
determined
second
and
third
development
strategic
objectives
,
and
striving
to
realize
the
peaceful
unity
of
the
motherland
as
early
as
possible
.

Jonah
was
a
sign
for
those
who
lived
in
Nineveh
.

He
said
that
currently
the
Fijian
military
has
completely
taken
over
the
government
and
the
parliament
,
and
is
in
control
of
the
entire
country
.

And
I
think
the
reality
is
that
when
people
like
her
go
over
there
there
's
a
public
affairs
officer
standing
right
next
to
that
young
soldier
.

Well
they
can
visit
him
and
come
on
him

And
with
the
quiet
pragmatism
of
Mr.
Guzman
Cabrera
replacing
the
prickly
populism
of
La
Quina
,
government
technocrats
have
been
given
a
free
hand
to
open
the
petrochemical
sector
to
wider
private

foreign
investment

It
is
well
known
that
the
notion
of
the
individual
cash
share
from
oil
revenues
is
an
alternative
to
the
provisions
ration
,
and
not
a
supplement
to
it
.

For
example
,
if
you
have

your
normal

to

's

Right.

If
our

in

But
while

say
that

good

you

on
the
other
hand
he
's
saying
that
because
you
know
he
's
not

That
rate
would
gradually

little
as

I
was
angry

the

believe

no

subscribes

Right.

But
in

the

thing
about

is
not
which

said
I
believe
this
decision
must
be
respected
and
for
the
first
time
describes
the
opposition
leader
as
President

elect

but
he
said
he
would
not
ignore
the
support
of
those
who
did
vote
for
him
in
election
of
September
24th
and
would
therefore
lead
his
forces
to
become
a
strong
opposition
party
,
which
he
said
would
win
convincingly
in

next

not

further

in

to
appear
magnanimous

you
got

And
when

are

flawed

A
decade

so

while

was

he
developed
an
interest
in

hoped
to

Another

came

stood
at

All
the

does
point
very
clearly
that
the

came
outside

He
is
from

I
believe
that
public
opinion
is
much
closer
to
Bennett
on
this
point
than
some
of
the
other
uh
members
of
the
press
in
the
discussion

At
the

time
,
Casey
also
spoke
in

of

The

When
some

of

saw

eating

out

had

470

in

as
of
June
.

Here
is
the
point
of
what
we
are
saying
:
We
have
a
high
priest
like
that
,
who
sits
on
the
right
side
of
God
's
throne
in
heaven
.

One
of
the
residents
of
the
prefecture
,
a
man
named
Chen
Lie
,
satirized
the
magistrate
's
order
with
a
verse
that
he
painted
on
a
large
lantern
:

I
more
often
buy
aromatic
oils
and
use
them
at
home
-
just
take
a
fragrant
bath
or
heat
the
oil
to
diffuse
the
fragrance
.

The
valley
was
between
them
.

Then
what
is
this
theory
of
old
-
fashioned
private
school
for
,
eh.

So
I
patiently
accept
all
these
troubles
.

He

The
solution
is
functional
human
settlement
patterns
and
a
balance
between
transport
system
capacity
and

use
generated
travel
deman
.

The
rest
,
as
they
say
,
is
history
.

Rodeo
applause
:
broncs
cheer
.

So
he
spoke
about
him
.

This
is
not
my
principle
,
nor
is
my
job
.

and
what
about
this
mental
?

If
Saddam

the

have

naturally
without

Clashes
engendered
by
the
intensity
of
conflicts
between
some
local
governments
and
the
general
public
have
created
very
bad
social
effects
.

Then
a

army
of

from

joined
the

,
and
they
were
all
praising
God

The

The
new

time

how
well

plenty

complaints

a

Simon
Chang
,
who
left
the
job
of
director
of
planning
at
the
National
Science
Council
only
six
months
ago
to
enter
the
private
sector
,
points
out
that
the
knowledge
-
based
economy
basically
deals
in
information
technology
,
and
the
IT
industry
is
the
most
profitable
region
in
the
emerging
geography
of

Well
,
this
is
a
brief
introduction
of
the
context
of
the
incident
.

You
see
,
I
know
my
father
would
have
wished
me
to
carry
on
just
now
.
''

He
hit
defensive
barriers
nearby
and
blew
himself
up.

''
But
the
enterprises
still
in
state
hands
include
the
biggest
and
most
economically
powerful
ones
in
Mexico
;
indeed
,
they
virtually
constitute
the
economic
infrastructure
.

But
someone
there
without
understanding
can
not
say
``
Amen
''
to
your
prayer
of
thanks
,
because
they
do
n't
know
what
you
are
saying
.

So
the
only
thing
to
do
is
keep

where
classes
are
more
ideally
sized
.

The

of
land
for
research
laboratories
.

A
net
worth
of
$
300
million
.

There
is
no
reason
that
it
can
not
be
done
for
defense
planning
.

Most
notably
,
the

of

the

.

Even
Carlos
Manuel

Many
of
the

involved
transactions
in

commercialize
their
work
in

equity
stake
or
royalties
.

So
...
the
purely
scientific
and
technological
side
can
not
justify
what
is
happening
in
Qatar
.

I
saw

took

And
what
does
it
go
into

I
think
heard
someone
say
something
.

Officials
at
London
's
Millennium
Dome
say
the
structure
will
close
down
after
a
final
New

It
's
the
duty
of
international
community
to
restore
as
much
as
possible
to
the
museum
and
then
,
I
think
,
the
international
community
must
organize
itself
to
help
the
Iraqi
colleagues
restore
what
is
left
.

But
Festus
wanted

are

any

,
considered

the
execution

the
former
Iraqi

Saddam

public
murder

what
is
that
.

And
I
think
reporters
need
to
really
continue
to
go
outside
their
area
of
comfortability
outside

Green

But
in

those

will
get
the
punishment
they
deserve

has
wilted
to
some
extent

after

the

has
been

Officials

Um
there
's
a
big
gap
between
those
that
are
mentally
ill
and
the
general
population
.

I
say
,
two
things
.

I
particularly
like
this
:
Another
way
of
looking
at
this
is
that
if
new
folks
had
to
pay
their
actual
share
of
infrastructure
costs
-there
would
be
less
money
for
bigger
homes
and
new
SUV
and
long
solo
commutes
.

She
says
there
is
an
acknowledgment
from
those
officials
that
there
are
not
enough
ground
troops
in
place
and
particularly
in
Baghdad
to
control
what
our
Nic
Robertson
is
saying
is
a
stage
of
anarchy
in
some
parts
of
Iraq
.

And
I
,

When
it
comes
to
busting
ghosts
,
the
Monroe
,
Conn.
,
couple
are
perfect
demons
.

Many
are
surprised
to
find
how
different
the
results
are
!

But
when
we
obey
God
's
teaching
,
his
love
is
truly
working
in
us
.

Help
make
that
person
right
again
,
and
do
it
in
a
gentle
way
.

Yet
too
many
people
working
in
Hollywood
today
seem
to
suffer
from
the
delusion
that
the

played
out

will
be
interesting
to
people
who
live
somewhere
else

Mr.
Mayor
's
hope
that
references
to
``
press
freedom
''
would
survive
unamended
seems
doomed
to
failure
;
the
current
phrasing
is
``
educating
the
public
and
media
to
avoid
manipulation
.
''

One
answer
is
that
big
companies
are
growing
weary
of
fighting
environmental
movements
and
are
trying
instead
to
cash
in
on
them
,
although
they
never
care
to
put
it
quite
that
way
.

of

ah.

The
money
spent
on

will
be
counted
as
a
plus

the

does
not
effectuate

change

he
put

This

partially
in

As
the

concluded
,
``
Our
government
did
nothing

the
first
priority

arranged
for

to
watch
it

.

So
many
people
have
so
many
negative
things
to
say
about
it

This
is
definitely
not
because
prehistoric
people
were
unable
to
get

Among
the
issues
the

whether

That

derailed

Rival

Legal

The

I
bow
to
no
one
in
my
regard
for

if
we
are
serious
about

we
must
look
at
the

not

lock
us
into

At

by
its

last

After
mulling
over

Cheng
decided
that
he
is
going

save
up
money
to

One
of

may

I
was
thinking
,
a
few
will
get
trampled
.

The
government
is
not
the
executive
branch
.

White
House
spokesmen
last
week
said
Mr.
Bush
is
considering
simply
declaring
that
the
Constitution
gives
him
the
power
,
exercising
a
line
-
item
veto
and
inviting
a
court
challenge
to
decide
whether
he
has
the
right
.

His
campaign
was
caught
flat

footed
amid
allegations
it
paid
almost
$
10,000
for
what
it
said
was
a
``
get
-out-
the
-
vote
''
effort
by
black
activist
Sonny
Carson
,
a
convicted
kidnapper
who
later
said
publicly
that
he
is
``
anti-white

''

They
throw

The
stock

has
bounced
back
from
a
weak
start

The
abrupt
management
change
sparked
widespread
speculation
that
Mr.
Roman
had
been
pushed
out
of
Ogilvy

top
spot

Mr.
Sorrell
.

You
just
said
that
when
you
went
to
see
a
car
show
,
you
first
look
at
enterprises

and
she
wanted
some
chewing
gum

You
might
remember
last
week
when
another
half
-
brother
of
Saddam
Hussein
was
picked
up
trying
to
cross
into
Syria
and
that
time
,
we
have
been
told
Syria
has
closed
its
border
with
Iraq
to
prevent
any
of
that
ongoing
.

She

Spartak

the
only
team
that
uses
artificial
turf
,
and
it
will
be
a
great
test
for
the
Internazionale
Milan

Rather
,
they
will
hide
their
aims
behind
sweet

So
Ahab
called
a
meeting
of

Washington
State
's
Mr.
Norton
.

He
promised
to
reduce
poverty
,
which
could
mean
an
open

with
the
United

fewer

The
world
is
passing
away
,
and
all
the
things
that
people
want
in
the
world
are
passing
away

To
do
so
,
the
judge
said
,
the
U.S.
courts
must
review
the
judicial
process
in

foreign

I
remember
people
sniffing
at
it

saying
they
would
n't
do
it

the
payback
on

One
simple
approach
is
to
exclude

this
can
avoid

also
can

there

These
things
have
come

been
thrown
out.

For
any

it

how
steeply

rise

One
might
also
ask
:
At
what

does
it
become
unfair

I

the

that
when

It

There
also

The
subject
of
oil
from
a
sectarian
or
regional
point
of
view
was
not
presented
except
as
a
cover
for
the
important
main
questions
about
the
oil
policy
,
these
being
Firstly
:
the
abrogation
of
Act
80
1961
and
its
cancellation
,
by
successively
handing
over
unexploited
oilfields
and
areas
to
foreign
companies
on
the
basis
of
long
-
term
participation
in
production
contracts
,
instead
of
developing
them
nationally
by
supporting
the
national
oil
companies
and
making
use
of
foreign
expertise
through
short
-
term
service
contracts
that
would
leave
the
wealth
in
Iraq
's
hands
.
Secondly
:
the
weakening
of
the
Iraq
's
negotiating
power
by
weakening
the
centralization
of
contracting
for
the
national
resources
with
foreign
companies
and
the
instruments
of
such
contracting
;
not
distinguishing
between
the
need
to
expand
the
administrative
powers
of
the
companies
and
institutions
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
need
for
the
centralization
of
the
major
national
economic
decisions
on
the
other
.

At
this
time
you
have
plenty
and
can
provide
what
they
need
.

This
is
true
for

how

Hamas

Quite
the

it
results
from
years
of
work
by
members
of
the
National

Well
if
you
look
at
justice
,
you
would
think
--
That
's
all
.--
that
Iraq
should
've
been
killed
a
long
time
ago
.

This
was
before
Abraham
had
any
children

The
first
is
the
presence
of
a
technical

in

,
he
was

there

If
we
wait
until

we
will
be
punished

Teach
them

that
I
have

Sporadic
clashes
continued
Sunday
in
the
Gaza
Strip
and
two
Palestinians
were
killed
by
Israeli
forces
.

You
heard
them
from

told

The

And
one
mother
wrote
a
note

"
In
terms
of
quality

,
Taipei
is
ahead

it
's
a
step
behind
when
it
comes
to
bringing
out
the

for
an

"
Chen
admits

And
during
the

Christmas
falls
on

Monday
,
creating
a
big
last

minute

opportunity
for

Despite
the
widening
gap
between
the
two
sides
,
conferees
eventually
followed
the
pattern
set
in
previous
years
by
opting
to
roughly
split
the
difference
.

On
Oct.
22
,
led
by
Saudi
Arabia
,
the
world
's
largest
exporter
,
they
embargoed
oil
shipments
to
the
U.S.
and
to
the
Netherlands
,
Israel
's
staunchest
European
ally
.

Some
enterprises
have
already
recouped
initial
investments
.

So
live
for
what
is
in
heaven
,
where
Christ
is
sitting
at
the
right
hand
of
God
.

They
cheered
the
U.S.
invasion
;

All
of
this
is
in
the
works
now
,
but
I
think
it
's
going
to
take
quite
a
few
years
to
develop
it
.

Do
they
want
the
spotlight
for
themselves
or
for
their
cause
?

As
soon
as
the
captain
received
the
order
of
the
governor
,
everyone
coordinated
with
Lieutenant
Colonel
'Id
Matar
al
-
Nafi'i
to
bring
his
relative
,
the
aforementioned
person
who
filed
the
report
.

Is
that
true
.

It
was
a
nice
thing
.

They
were
punished
when
they
did
not
obey
that
teaching
.

So
when
we
look
back
again
now
,
there
is
a
huge
difference
between
the
current
negotiations
and
the
past
negotiations
.

what
lessons
should
mankind
learn
from
this
great
disaster
?

The
No.

maker
's
new
Thunderbird
and
Mercury
Cougar
models
have
n't
met
sales
expectations
in
the
year

they
were
introduced
,
and
Ford

are
losing
ground
to
their
GM

.

Arza
was
the
man
in

Those

could
be
a
factor
as
the

decides
how
Sammy
Sosa
will
be
punished
for
using
a
cork

filled

People
like
Senator
Kyl
and
I
who
've
supported
uh
the
war
in
Iraq
uh
know
how
important
victory
is
.

And
darkness
covered

The

also
bar

The
Fleet
Commander
then
decided
to
have
even
that
one
body
handed
back
to
the
sea
where
the
submarine
went
down
says
Pedro
.

It
says
that
despite
loose
regulation
of
the
market
itself
,
its
longstanding
regulation
of
industry
will
prevent
such
crashes
.

The
US
calls
on
the
Taliban
movement
to
end
its
sponsorship
of
international
terrorism
and
hand
over
the
terrorist
fugitives
it
now
protects
.

So
do
n't
join
yourselves
to
them

He
used
his
sword
and
killed
men
,
women
,
children
and
small
babies

Few
now
recall
the
actual
outcome
:
Scopes
was
convicted
and
fined
$
100
,
and
his
conviction
was
reversed
on
appeal
because
the
fine
was
excessive
under
Tennessee
law
.

They
are
trying
to
narrow
their
differences
over
a
US
framework
for
negotiating
a
final
peace
agreement
.

A
Ford
spokesman
said
the
Dearborn
,
Mich.
,
auto
maker
is
n't
aware
of
any
injuries
caused
by
the
windshield
problem
.

He
said
to
them
,
``
When
you
go
into
the
city
,
you
will
see
a
man
carrying
a
jar
of
water
.

He
also
noted
that
present
relations
between
Kyrgyzstan
and
China
are
developing
at
a
high
level
,
and
that
the
mutual
cooperation
has
been
fruitful
and
beneficial
to
both
countries
.

He
expects
the
price
for
that
product
to
rise
even
more
next
year
.

You

only
to
cheat

It
's
about

I

If
you
wanted
to
build
a

you
would
first
sit
down
and
decide
how

it
would
cost

Some

less
predictable
than

Secretary
of
State
Baker
,
we
read
,
decided
to
kill
a
speech
that
Robert
Gates
,
deputy
national
security
adviser

was
going
to

In

,
the

closely
connected

about
the
roles
governments
should
play

Now
NBC
's
chief
financial
correspondent
Mike
Jensen
on
the
new
surplus
and
all
the
talk
behind
it
,
``
in

''

I
do
not
know
how
to
say
it
any
more
clearly
than
that
.

On
the
contrary
,
it
should
be
the

as
expected
by
private
enterprises

Now
without
Saddam
Hussein
you
can
look
across
the

and
see
that
uh
a

is
changing

to
the

promotion
and
the
hard
work
of
people
in

Yet
,
his
political
setbacks
mounted
.

On
Tuesday
President
Putin
called
for
an
end
to
the
American
trade
embargo
against
Cuba
.

The
sheriff
's
department
did
n't
respond
to
our
um
reported
threats
by
Eric
Harris
against
our
son
for
thirteen
months

You
will
be
ready
for
any

So
then
,
in
practice
,
I
let
the
peasants
invest
50

50

For
the
first
nine
months
,
advertising
pages
in
consumer
magazines

by
the
Publishers
Information
Bureau
increased
4
%
from
the
same

last

to

And
sooner
or
later
,
we
have
to
do
something
about
it

I
will
do
something

But
since
Time

merger
with
Warner
Communications
Inc.
,
relations
between
the

become

but
I
've

so
much
more

than
she
does

I

Only
with

debentures
due
2001
and
$
200
million
of
zero
coupon
liquid
yield

notes
due
2004
.

If
it
was
n't
for
her
decisiveness
,
this
house
may
well
not
have
belonged
to
us
.

Well
I
think
the
best
uh
that
anybody
can
do
and
I
sort
of
offer
this
to
anyone
is
to
just
start
the
dialog
with
your
children
um
talk
to
them
about
their
moods
and
how
they
really

well
be

n't
you
like

that

What
accounts
for
the
results
of
recent
decades
?

Jeroboam
son
of
Nebat
was
still
in
Egypt
where
he
had
run
away
from
Solomon
.

Do
this
so
that
God
can
heal
you
.

That
secret
truth
,
which
is
for
all
people
,
is
that
Christ
lives
in
you
,
his
people
.

Is
he
the
only
one
who
came
back
to
give
praise
to
God
?
''

That
promise
is
that
we
can
enter
his
place
of
rest
.

It
sends
a
message
to
terrorist
states
like
Iran
or
Cuba
.

Um
,
for
example
,,
the
Lu
jiatuo
mine
had
a
vertical
-
shaft
ladder
,
and
at
the
time
there
were
more
than
a
thousand
people
in
the
mine
,
male
,
female
,
old
and
young
.

David
went
to
fight
wherever
Saul
sent
him
.

Then
Jesus
told
the
Good
News
in
the
synagogues
in
Judea
.

But
David
did
n't
let
any
of
those
people
live
.

You

``
But
the

said
to
his
servants
,

Hurry

Then
Joab
got
up
and
went
to
Geshur
and
brought
Absalom
to
Jerusalem
.

In
the
extremely
nationalistic
atmosphere
of
the
1970s
,
Huang
changed
his
focus
for
a
time
,
writing
about
the
hatred
of
Japan
Sayonara
,
Goodbye
and
about
anti-American
sentiments
I
Love
Mary
.

All
she
remembers
is
that
when
the
war
ended
,

was
turned
over

External
pressure
is
an
opportunity
for

They

felt
she

General

But
there
is
one
thing
I
do
:
I
forget
what
is
in
the
past
and
try
as
hard
as
I
can
to
reach
the
goal
before

He
cited
the
case
of
a
Swiss
oil
trader

put
out

via

tanker
to
pick
up
a
cargo
of

and
he
wants
to
support
the
cause
.

Every
time
the
church
came
together
,
Barnabas
and
Saul
met
with
them
and
taught
many
people
.

However
,
those
who
are
allowed
to
take
tips
in
China
are
precisely
those
who
are
not
allowed
to
take
tips
in
the
US
.

you
think
it
's
fair
do
n't
you
District
Attorney
to
look
at
this
tape
and
be
horrified
?

Family
members
and
close
allies
of
former
President
Slobodan
Milosevic
are
leaving
Yugoslavia
ahead
of
possible
investigations
into
their
financial
dealings
.

Many
of
the
elements
that
make
up
the
film
are
remnants
of
objective
reality
.

The
partnership
that
exists
between
Iraqi
units
and
American
units
is
certainly
much
stronger
and
much
more
robust
than
that
article
uh
would
indicate
.

The
lights
must
be
turned
on.

It
's
a
homeland
of
the
soul
for
every
one
of
us
.

They
were
all
made
from

This
means
Interior

can
not
be
logged
only
on

a
Sunday
that
had
already
passed

In
Egypt
,
President
Hosni
Mubarak
's
ruling
party
is
claiming
victory
in
the
second
of
three
rounds
of
voting
in
parliamentary
elections
,
but
as
VOA
's
Scott
Bob
reports
from
Cairo
,
Islamic
candidates
also
made
significant
gains
accompanied
by
some
of
the
election
's
worst
violence
.

The
question
should
be
what
is
the
chicken
getting
out
of
this
.

``
There
wo
n't
be
any
formal
resolutions
or
communiques
,
I
do
n't
think
.

I
have
peace
in
my
heart
knowing
that
I
was
n't
involved
in
this
except
for
you
know
the
relationship
that
I
had
with
Bill
Flin
which
I
've
already
I
believe
you
know
put
myself
through
enough
behind
.

But
under
the
proposed
guidelines
,
all
federally
funded
research
will
have
to
be
reported
publicly
so
that
anyone
can
capitalize
on
the
work
.

So
the
Jewish
leaders
warned
the
apostles
again
and
let
them
go
free
.

You
do
n't
want

Curiously
,
he
compares
the
Orange
Workers
to
the
ANC

which
his
father
outlawed
in
1960
.

Many
of
them
were
killed
in
the
battle
.

Prices
peaked
at

1,150,000
in
September

The
Philistine
came
out
every
morning
and
evening
and
stood
before
the
Israelite
army

But
investors
who
are
preoccupied
with
short
-
term
fluctuations
may
be
paying
too
little
attention
to
another
big
risk
--
not
generating
enough
money
to
meet
long

financial
and
life

ceremony

with
that
,
starting
his

His

range
from
the
absurd

profusely
endued
with

Sterling
had
completed
a
five

However
,
I
am
doubtful
if
it

become

a
powerful
country
with
an
independent
foundation
as
its
core

a

of

After
14
years
I
went
back
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
and
took
Titus
with
me
.

There
was
almost
no
guidance
from
the
court
on
how
to
do
it
.

They
did
this
to
make
the
Lord
angry
.

We
think
that
,
eh
,
it
is
exactly
,
eh
,
in
the
process
of
independent
innovation
,
then
,
we
ca
n't
completely
cut
ourselves
off
from
the
outside
world
.

That
evening
after
sunset
,
as
soon
as
he
received
the
phone
call
from
the
governor
,
the
captain
took
me
out
of
the
group
detention
area
.

Later
,
Paul
left
Athens
and
went
to

city

Corinth

But
you
outsmart
the
wicked
,
no

how
clever
they
are
.

All
right

I
thought
it
was
shameful
.

He
met
Philip
and
said
to
him
,
``
Follow

well
they
do

The
government
,
in
turn
,
guaranteed
financing
to
complete
the

backlog
and
took
control
of
the

Except
the
people
at
Treasury
and
again
Tom
Kean
are
saying
this
thing
has
now
destroyed
the
capacity
of
our
program

With
consumers
like
him
,
who
do
n't
throw
their
money
around

despite
the
proliferation

traditional
gyms
have
not
been
badly
affected

Abijah
was
not
faithful
to
the
Lord
his
God
.

Al
Daqamsa
had
previously
refused
to
have
the
operation
performed
at
Al
Basheer
Hospital
,
which
the
prison
had
assigned
for
him
.

He
was
like
God
in
every
way
,
but
he
did
not
think
that
his
being
equal
with
God
was
something
to
use
for
his
own
benefit
.

The
part
of
the
Scriptures
that
he
was
reading
was
this
:
``
He
was
like
a
sheep
being
led
to
the
butcher

Jonadab

In
the
battle
to
supply
desktop
computers
for

most
of
the
attention
is
given
to
the
biggest
competitors
:
Sun
Microsystems
Inc.
,
Hewlett

Packard
Co.
and
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
,
which
make
computers
mainly
aimed
at
a
wide
range
of
engineering
and
scientific
needs
.

The
problem
is
there
are
n't
enough
tents
here
or
anywhere
else
.

Then
,
a
scientific
team
led
by
molecular
geneticist
Webster
Cavenee
,
then
at
the
University
of
Utah
,
found
the
answer
.

That
's
generally
true
,
but
it
's
only
true
on
some
issues
,
and
in
this
case
,
you
could
argue
that
the
Bush
people
are
going
to
the
Supreme
Court
to
preserve
the
right
of
Florida
,
to
determine
its
own
electors

The

the
rate

rose

Otherwise
a
gas
tax
set
high
enough
to
do
its
job
is
still
a
fairer
and
cheaper
method
,
and
more
environmentally
friendly
:

they
would
prefer
that
there
be
nothing
there
other
than
undisturbed
and
unmaintained
land

But
when
they

Therefore
,
in
order
to
deepen
our
understanding
of
what
Chinese
traitors
and
their
harm
are
,
enhance
our
concept
of
nationality
,
and
take
action
to
resolutely
combat
treason
,
it
is
extremely
necessary
to
analyze
the
differences
and
similarities
between
the
ancient
and
modern
Chinese
traitors
.

But
as
the
outcry
faded
by
the
spring
of
1988
,
they
resumed
.

Others
analyze
the
data
.

So

Now
she
looks
very
mature
for
her
age

The
packaged

goods
marketers
may
try
filling
that
gap
with
a
spate
of
new

Qichen
Qian
made
the
above
comments

from

you

In
implementing
the
orders
,
Mansour
went
with
a
group
of
his
assistants
on
January

,
2005
,
two
days
before
the
celebration
,
to
the
restaurant
,
where
he
started
to
plant
an
explosive
package
containing
15

Like
many

Mr.

cynic

You
mean

Scottish
folks
?

it
gives
them

in
the

Even
stranger
is
the
case
of
Usha
Rectifier
,

For

what

The

There
is
no
stronger
evidence
of
the
ignorance
by
a
large
sector
of
the
possibility
of
separation
because
of
inequality
in
lineage
than
the
social
debate
stirred
up
by
this

which
was
not

extended
to

,

among

the

after

The
speech
put
a
heavy
stress
on

rights
,

reflection
of
the
high
expectations
the
public
holds
for

should
be

the

this

arrogance

abuse

frequently
see
that
the
viewpoint
of

is
:
When
the
foreign

funded
banks
arrive
later

if
your
service
attitude
does
n't
improve
a
bit
,
I
will
take
my
money
and
deposit
it
in
a
foreign

So
,
when
it

its

Skipping
personal
pleasantries
,
Mr.
Lee
picked
up
exactly
where
he
left
off
several
months
earlier
--
before
the
government
crackdown
in
China
--when
he
had
warned
that
the
orthodox
leadership
in
Beijing
feared
a
plurality
of
views
.

And
it
was
carried
uh
in
a
lot
of
places
.

It
comes
down
to
a
question
of
whether
to
try
to
``

Secrets
to
success

Concerned
departments
of
the
Henan
provincial
government
promulgated
this
province
's
foreign
economy
and
technological
cooperation
projects
at
the
conference
,
and
conference
representatives
negotiated
on
the
cooperative
intention
of
related
projects
.

They
base
their
argument
on
a
clause
buried
in
Article
I
,
Section
7
,
of
the
Constitution
that
states
:
``
Every
order
,
resolution
,
or
vote
to
which
the
concurrence
of
the
Senate
and
House
of
Representatives
may
be
necessary
except
on
a
question
of
adjournment
shall
be
presented
to
the
President
of
the
United
States
;
and
before
the
same
shall
take
effect
,
shall
be
approved
by
him
or
...
disapproved
by
him
....
''

Among

are

They
are
not
pleasing

they
are

One
of
the
seven
angels
came
to
me
.

I
go
well
there
's
this
thing
.

Dear
Brothers
:
We
have
heard
that
some
men
have
come
to
you
from
our
group
.

Within
the
last
year
,
gleaming
new
health
centers
have
set
up
shop
in
the
Tong
Lin
Department
Store
in
the
Eastern
District
,
the
NOVA
shopping
center
near
the
train
station
,
and
the
Spring
Galaxy
theater
complex
in
Hsimenting
.

She
in
turn
died
when
Hsia
was
13
,
after
which
he
went
to
live
with
an
uncle
and
aunt
in
Hankou
.

The
FBI
's
role
is
to
complement
the
D.C.
initiative
through
not
only
these
major
trafficking
investigations
,
but
also
by
providing
a
full
range
of
services
through
various
task
forces
and
our
contacts
with
local
police
squads
handling
drug
-
related
crimes
.

It
currently
costs
$
750
,
though
Mr.
Sinyard
thinks
the
price
can
be
reduced
within
three
years
to
between
$
200
and
$
250
.

This
infatuation
with
city
living
truly
baffles
me
.

They
rejected
him
.

The
only
sign
will
be
the
miracle
that
happened
to
Jonah
.

The
U.S.
government
is
warning
American
citizens
living
and
traveling
abroad
to
be
on
alert
as
violence
continues
in
the
Mideast
.

Earlier
this
year
,
New
York
Life
Insurance
Co.
agreed
to
acquire
Windsor
Group
Ltd.
,
a
first
step
toward
establishing
a
presence
in
the
European
market
ahead
of
1992
.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
told
his
Cabinet
he
would
declare
a
``
time
-
out
''
to
re-evaluate
the
Mideast
peace
process
,
in
light
of
recent
events
.

About
8,000
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
members
resumed
their
strike
against
De
Beers
Consolidated
Mines
Ltd.
after
further
negotiations
to
settle
a
wage
dispute
broke
down
.

One
of
the
plan
's
authors
has
defended
the
``
socioeconomic
disadvantage
''
category
as
perhaps
making
more
sense
than
the
current
affirmative
-
action
preferences
based
on
race
.

and
he
said
you
really
ca
n't
get
informed
consent
.

And
he
has
put
them
all
together
as
people
who
do
n't
obey
him
so
that
he
can
show
mercy
to
everyone
.

Then
the
great
and
glorious
day
of
the
Lord
will
come
.

And
he
nearly
always
bought
and
sold
for
cash
.

But
will
the
lessons
of
2006
be
the
key
to
success
in
2007
?

And
they
are
the
ones
who
take
you
to
court
.

``
Look
,
''
he
says
,
``
If
the
rest
of
South
Africa
wants
to
have
an
integrated
melting
pot
,
that
's
their
choice
.

The
most
obvious
part
of
China
's
being
a
big
country
was
its
population
advantage
.

It
's
going
to
be
great
.

Saul
was
still
at
Gilgal
.

I
believe
now
that
the
Senate
will
pass
the
legislation
that
we
're
talking
about
which
is

Mr.

According
to
some
who
attended
,
the
senators
argued
that
the
president
should
give
the
Democratic
leaders
in
Congress
a
victory
of
their
own
to
compensate
them
for
allowing
the
president
to
win
on

Its
keyboard
,
according
to
industry
consultants
,
is
better
than
Compaq

,
but
its
battery
life
of
two
to
three
hours
is
shorter
.

Prior
to
the
introduction
of
financial
futures
in
the
late
1970s
,
most
trading
firms
clustered
around
the
LaSalle
Street
financial
district
here
were
family
operations
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
the
next
.

Absalom
's
servants
came
to
the
woman
at
the

It
reduces
the
baseline
by

169
billion
.

During
the
"
Week
of
Dalian
"
in
Japan
,
fourteen
events
of
fairly
large
scale
were
planned
,
such
as
the
Presentation
and
Consultation
on
the
Dayaowan
Bonded
Port
Area
,
the
Promotional
Fair
on
Dalian
's
Key
Industrial
Park
Areas
,
the
Japan
-
China
Economic
Forum
,
the
IT
Products
Presentation
,
and
various
exchange
activities
.

Then
Samuel
left
and
went
to
Ramah
.

The
scale
of
their
crimes
is
not
less
than
the
crimes
of
the
tyrant
and
his
bloodthirsty
cousin
,
Chemical
Ali
.

Uh
we
come
back.

This
objective
is
stipulated
in
the
outline
of
the
foreign
economic
and
trade
development
plan
of
the
"
ninth

"
1996

formulated
by

So
now
when
they
eat
meat
,
they
still
feel
as
if
it
belongs
to
an
idol
.

CHRISTMAS

He
refuses
to

"
In
addition
,
you
should
regularly
measure
the
length
of
your
feet
,
because
increasing
age
and

can
change
the

of
your

God

On
this
basis
,
one
must
caution
against
companies
that
try
to
invest
in
the
production
of
crude
oil
without
being
prepared
to
invest
in
the
associated
and

The

Battle
,

Then
he
said
,
``

because
these
words
are
true
and
can
be

The
judge
dismissed
the

ordered
Mr.

to
pay
over

100,000

Mr.

I

This
is
only
because

kept

were
loyal

were
steadfast

tough
on

left

again

He
was
in

again

about

He

best
known

which
appeared

And

talking

And
we

and
before

also
,
let
us
remember
it
well
;
this
is
why
Yasser
Arafat
was
put
under
siege
and
there
was
the
Al

Aqsa
Intifadah
and
there
was
a
re-invasion
,
because
the
struggle
was
renewed
,
because
we
refused

the
Israeli
dictates
.

you
're

For
example

they
postulate
that

Since

Before
John
came
,
the
Law

told

Well
I

could
probably
look

People
are
beginning
to
develop
the
accountability
systems
to
show
your
states
and
your
communities
that
you
're
doing
your
job
,
leaving
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
the
parents
and
taxpayers
and
citizens
,
some
of
whom
praise
public
schools
,
some
are
critical
of
public

,
that
you
're
performing
.

Indeed
,
abortion
-

activists
still
face
their
greatest
tests

um
in
terms
of
where
they
are
trying
to
attain
a
goal
of
a
hundred
percent
readiness
they
're
at
sixty
percent
.

As
a
result
,
last
March
the
General
Services
Administration
board
of
contract
appeals
directed
NASA
to
reopen
negotiations
on
the
contract
.

He
said
and
these
are
his
words
,
``
Libya
as
a
state
has
no
responsibility
in
this
affair

That
is
humongous
.

This
aims
for
a
middle

between
the
KMT

"

We

says
Steve
Fiala

That
pace
is
causing
some
analysts
to
speculate
that
the
Soviet
Union
might
soon
purchase
as
much
as
another
two
million

tons
.

and
some
of
them
would
just
come
out
and
just
stare
you
know
just
be
like
all
and
just
kind
of
in
amazement
wondering
what
we
're

there
's

It
is
said
that
the

have
been

certainly
goes
to
show
the
degree

openness

it

fetch

Judging
from
the

it

probable
that

disguised

the

I
mean
,

Jeffrey

Peter

Joseph

run

three
operating

But
it
is
high
enough
to
prod
the
search
for
future
supplies
,
low
enough
to
promote
consumption

,
most
important
,
steady
enough
for
both
producers

users
to
believe
in.

Now
he
is

right

Outgoing
President
Slobodan
Milosevic
congratulated
Mr.
Kostunica
in
a
Friday
television
appearance
.

In
the
context
of
his
announcement
there
are
two
important
points
:

GE
Capital
has
a
working
relationship
with
L.J.
Hooker
.

This
is
the
only
way
you
can
keep
your
riches
from
being
lost
.

If
you
kind
of
like
having
safer
streets
and
a
cleaner
environment
,
and
knowing
your
national
government
is
supporting
school
reforms
at
work
and
helping
more
people
get
access
to
health
care
while
we
grow
the
economy
,
you
got
to
vote
for
Al
Gore
and
Joe
Lieberman
.

There
is
a
large
portion
of
people
who
get
married
without
keeping
in
mind
-
out
of
ignorance
-
this
issue
,
which
can
threaten
their
family
life
at
any
moment
when
a
member
of
the
wife
's
family
objects
to
the
lineage
of

One
of
the
men
in
the
crowd
said
to
Jesus
,
``
Teacher
,
our
father
just
died
and
left
some
things
for
us
.

She
's
very
interesting
,
actually
.

It
's
a
tough
bill
.

So
Elijah
went
with
the
captain
to
see
King
Ahaziah
.

They
cursed
the
name
of
God
,
who
had
control
over
these
plagues
.

Then
the
two
men
told
what
had
happened
on
the
road
.

The
lawyers
also
monitor
suits
to
identify
specific
automobile
parts
that
cause
the
biggest
legal

That
's
much
more
affordable

Congress
is
in
no
position
to
naysay
Mr.
Bush
now
that
we
're
into
Gramm

Rudman
's
sequestration
.

We
left
the
Lord
,
and
we
served
the
false
gods
Baal
and
Ashtoreth
.

How
bad
it
will
be
for
you
people
who
are
laughing
now
,
because
you
will
be
sad
and
cry

According

I
agree
with

of

benefit
from

,
but
I
do
favor
higher

and
other
directly
related
user
fees
.

One
thing
that
made
me
sad
was
that
they
did
n't
care
at
all
about
what
I
thought
.

These
beliefs
so
dominate
our
educational
establishment
,
our

,
our
politicians
,
and
even
our
parents
that
it
seems
almost
blasphemous
to
challenge
them

It

not
the
kind
of
dynamic
which
I
think
we
ought
to
say
is
acceptable

Mr.

On
some
occasions
when
Mr.
Dinkins
has
discussed
the
issues
during

,
he
has
run
into
a
familiar
kind
of
trouble
.

This
is
a
first
step
on
the
long
road
to
full

.

In
others
a
familiar
old
name
still
prevails
,
but
the
underlying
game
has
changed
.

Yet
,
in
the
privatization
of
this
giant
,
it
turns
out
that
the
fairy
tale
of
"
big
returns
on
a
tiny
outlay
"
once
again
played
itself
out.

Now
,
it
will
auguster
into
the
surface
of
the
Red
Planet
and
put
those
samples
into
various
scientific
instruments
.

Others
,
however
,
have
thoughts

Mr.

among
them
,

the
evil
they
want

Any

said

``

now

we

bring

Assistant

on

Middle

Bureau
said
that
,
starting
this

,
financial
aid
for
the
research
of

will
be

increased
,
and
State

priority

I
think
that
China
has
again
fallen
into
a
very
foolish
,
a
ridiculously
savage
sort
of

;
approaching
the
kind
of

displayed

European

a

The

further

these
devices

bill
can
seem
like

To
be
sure
,
ignorance
of

is
not
recommended
,

looking
too
far
into
the
future
can
also
lead
to
disappointment

It
is
imperative
to
remove
the
environmental
subsidies
to
domestic

foreign
consumers
,
internalize
external
environmental
costs
of
Chinese
products
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
increase
the
prices
of
most
products
,
including
exports
,
in
order
to
alleviate
international
trade
frictions
,
reduce
the
pressure
for

appreciation

in

change
the
prospect

Avoiding

:
you

you

reaction

these
incidents

announcement

did
wrong

The

,
agreeing

found

``
arbitrary

capricious

``

prejudicial

government
around
that
time
adopted
a
policy
of
allowing
producers

By
further
increasing

with

and
actively
introducing

it
accelerated
the

Earlier
this
week
,
a
Fifth
Circuit
appellate
panel
upheld
Judge
Maloney
's
dismissal
of
Mr.
Gaubert
's
claim
as
a
shareholder
but
said
the
judge
should
reconsider
Mr.
Gaubert
's
claim
for
the
loss
of
his
property
.

The

says
,

About
this
time
tomorrow

there
will
be

again

Officials
have
a
concubine
to
share
joy
with
people
,
while
the
people
play
with
street
girls
to
go
whoring
.

At
the
ceremony
marking
the
commissioning
of
the
fifth

squadron
held
last
December
in
Hualien
,
there
were

The
Cypress
structure
opened
in
June
1957
,
and
as
such
,
like
many
buildings
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
,
does
not
meet
current
building
codes
requiring
considerably
more
steel
support
.

They
may
not
be
among
the
``
best
and
brightest
''
of
their
generation
--there
are
very
few
such
people
,
by
definition
.

The
U.S.
and
Canada
joined
every
European
country
except
Albania
at
the
meeting
.

Deputy
Director
Song
Chaozhi
stated
that
80
percent
of
mankind
's
information
is
related
to
geographical
location
.

Although
no
one
is
saying
so
,
it
seems
clear
that
Lee
's
visit
focused
primarily
on
cross-strait
relations
.

They
made
Asherah

And

The
main
capital
-
gains
tax
plan
in
the
Senate
is
n't
winning
support
from
Democrats
who
favor
a
reduction
.

And
out
of
necessity
:
The
U.S.
can
make
mistakes
and
still
hope
to
remove
him
from
power
,
but
a
single
error
on
his
part
could
cost
him
his
life
.

and
I
'll
tell
you
who
I
really
got
along
with
was
Patricia
Nixon
.

oh
first
of
all
I
have
Shana
's
shower
coming
up
that
I
have
to
do
.

Money
,
such
as
in
Recruit
's
political
donations
,
and
women
,
as
in
the
cases
of
Prime
Minister
Sosuke
Uno
and
Secretary
General
Tokuo
Yamashita
,
seldom
have
caused
political
scandals
in
Japan
.

In
practice
,
however
,
the
line
between
interpretation
and
redefinition
of
the
criminal
law
long
ago
began
to
blur
.

When
I
wrote
to
you
before
,
I
was
very
troubled
and
my
heart
was
full
of
sadness
.

I
am
telling
you
this
now
before
it
happens
.

Whoever
believes
in
the
Son
has
eternal
life
.

The
stars
will
fall
from
the
sky
,
and
everything
in
the
sky
will
be
changed

The
above
-
mentioned
development
zones
are
basically
located
in
the
southeastern
area
of
Fujian
whose
economy
is
the
most
active
.

Yesterday
and
today
,
the
Myanmaran
government
reopened
three
main
trading
ports
located
in
the
border
area
of
Myanmar
and
Thailand
that
were
closed
last
year
.

However
,
contrary
to
what
the
outsiders
have
expected
,
this
time
Wu
Bangguo
did
not
make
any
special
effort
to
support
Donald
Tsang
when
the
elections
of
the
Election
Committee
and
the
SAR
Chief
Executive
are
approaching
,
but
only
stressing
his
confidence
in
the
future
of
Hong
Kong
and
hoping
that
all
sectors
will
get
united
,
exercise
tolerance
,
and
properly
deal
with
the
existing
social
conflicts
and
differences
.

You
were
like
a
fool
who
takes
off
his

without

It
will
be
virtually
impossible
for
the
KMT
to
railroad
through
legislation
under
the
leadership
of
a
president
who
does
n't
enjoy
majority
public
support

But
now
I
have
chosen
Jerusalem
to
be
the

I
will

One
example

why

Quickview

said

lawsuit
against

,
claiming

in

But
in
order
to
safeguard
fundamental
benefits
to
the
people
of
all
east
Asian
countries
,
and
to
promote
the
lofty
cause
of

we
must
progressively

banking
grandees
by
such
new
business
barons
as
Saul

Well
if
this

continues
as
it

going
Peewee

He
said
,
``
You

``
If

[Jerry0803]
Should
n't
the
US
government
consider
it
seriously
?

So
God
said
to
him
,
``
You
did
not
ask
for
long
life
and
riches
for

But
during
the
night
,
an
angel

opened
the
doors
of

has
closed

This
is

once
a

year
rolls
around
,
the

is
sure
to
be
a

If

U.S.

estimated
that

Also
one

he
was

he
had

Soong
held
a
second
press
conference
on
December
18
.

In
his
condolence
message
to
El
Salvador
,
ROC
President
Chen
Shui
-
bian
stated
that
the
people
of
Taiwan
,
having
suffered
a
terrible
earthquake
of
their
own
in
September
1999
,
were
acutely
aware
of
what
people
in
El
Salvador
were
going
through
.

All
the
doors
of
the
jail
opened
,
and
the
chains
on
all
the
prisoners
fell
off.

He
imitated
the
speech
of
British
Prime
Minister
,
Tony
Blair
,
when
he
led
the
Labour
Party
to
win
the
general
election
in
1997
,
"
I
was
elected
because
of
the
new
Boris
image
.
I
will
show
the
new
Boris
style
in
governing
,
regardless
of
how
this
is
put
into
words
.
"

At
such
moments
Mr.
Boyd
makes
it
clear
that
he
has
the
capacity
to
be
a
superior
interpreter
of
Shakespeare
.

And
Dotty
,
Marianne
and
I
had
wanted
to
go
to
this
quilt

store
up
there

False
Christs
and
false
prophets
will
come
and
do
great
miracles
and
wonders
,
trying
to
fool
the
people
God
has
chosen
,
if
that
is
possible
.

These
movements
were
offset
,
however
,
by
a
steep
rise
in
corporate
income
tax
payments
to
199
million
francs
from
35
million
in
the
first
six
months
of
1988
.

There
were
still
some
of
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
service
of
Christ
who
must
be
killed
as
they
were
.

The
Jews
who
were
in
the
house
comforting
Mary
saw
her
get
up
and
leave
quickly
.

In
addition
to
my
fury
at
Duncan
I
became
furious
at
all
the
finger
pointing
in
Minnesota
.

Also
participating
in
the
issue
was
Servifilm
Spain
Cinematografica
S.A
.

Because
of
the
extreme
sensitivity
of
the
case
,
details
about
the
plea
arrangement
were
kept
under

These
men
brought
out
Joash
.

The
bill
gets
signed
into
law
and
then
the
administration
watches
helplessly
,
wondering
where
all
the
``
unexpected
''
costs
came
from
.

And
preventing
the
adoption
of
the
international
court
is
a
response
to
the
will
of
those
murderers
who
want
to
eliminate
Lebanon
's
youth
and
to
all
those
who
have
a
promising
future
in
a
sovereign
and
independent
country

The

On

the

released

of
the
world
economy
for
this

The

director
of

at

The

If
the
United

has
officially
restored
diplomatic
relations

President

calling
the
changes

Yugoslavia
remarkable

following
the
democratic
election
of
President
Vojislav
Kostunica
and
the
ouster
of
Slobodan

And
the
only
people
who
will
know
about

those

chooses
to
tell

That
the
membership
number
has
even
kept
close
to
its
1976
size
is
the
result
of
the
``
graying

of

Here

down

Coming

you
they

Jack
Ellis
,
a
U.S.
postal
inspector
in
New
York
,
says
the
Postal
Service
's
only
job
is
to
deliver
the
mail
to
the
mail
room
;
once
it
gets
there
,
a
company
can
do
with
it
what
it
wishes

Collectors
who
have
made
their
money
on
Wall
Street
have
become
an
increasingly
important
part
of
the
art
business
and
their
money
has
helped
fuel
the
art
boom
,
but
recently
it
appears
Sotheby
's
has
been
returning
the
compliment
.

So
this
is
all
new
drywall
in
here

Moscow
has
already
tacitly
admitted
that
the
ruble
is
n't
worth
much
,
announcing
in
August
that
it
will
pay
Soviet
farmers
in
hard
currency
for
grain
and
other
produce
that
they
grow
in
excess
of
state
-
plan
quotas
.

In
August
,
by
contrast
,
program
trading
averaged
10.3
%
of

Big

At
the
end
of
November
,
relevant
state
authorities
undersold
temporary
grain
reserves
twice
consecutively
in
a
seven
day
period
in
order
to
increase
the
supply
in
the
raw
grain
market
and
meet
enterprises
'
demand
for
grain
.

I
'm
like
I
just
do
n't

I

That

Meanwhile
,
Congress
is
cutting
huge
chunks
out
of
the
rest
of
the
defense
budget
.

These
rules
,
they
say
,
permit
faster
and
cheaper
trading
in

than
in

which
frequently
knocks
the
two

out

so
to

Yes

we

heard
such
talk
more
than
once
,
in
addition
to
the
sums
of
money
they
are
being
provided

Then
what
you

will
be
a

And
so
this

untruthful

He
said
that

in

that

The
problem
is
that
Taiwan
has
been
engaged
in
economic
diplomacy
for
many
years
now
,
yet
the
results
are
not

obvious

By
emphasizing
the
government
's
concern
for
human

on
the
international
stage
,
not
only
can
Taiwan
make
its
own
democratization
experience
available
for
other
countries
currently
going
through
the
same
process
,
it
can
bring
itself
closer
to
those
countries
which
also
place
a
strong
emphasis
on
human
rights
.

we
talked
about
it
.

Then

After

Furthermore
,
if
they
want

to
be

they
will
have
to
take

of

Afterwards
,
Eritrea
accused
the
United
Nations
of
not
forcing

to
carry
out
the
demarcation
and
began
adopting
measures
to
greatly
limit
the
range
of
activity
of

in
Ethiopia
and
Eritrea
.

the
fact
that
there
was
any
burial
at
,
to
my
mind
,
speaks
volumes
of
them
.

That
prophet
will
come
from
among

own
people

There
Zadok

priest
and
Nathan
the
prophet
will
anoint

The
American
White

admitted
on

that
when
the
air
force
of
the
multi-national
forces
made
air
attacks
on
Baghdad
,
the
capital
of
Iraq
,
they
caused
the
deaths
of
hundreds
of
civilians
in
Iraq
,
but
insisted
in
believing
that
what

forces
bombed
was
a
military
target
.

and

Fortunately
,
the
people
of
Peipu
quickly
realized
their
mistake
.

Yeah
you
're
on
.

He
is
part
teen
idol
,
part
king
in
the
making
,
but
unlike
his
father
,
Prince
Charles
,
who
is
likely
to
precede
him
to
the
throne
,
this
prince
disdains
being
called
your
Royal

Pharaoh

Analysts
are
concerned
that
much
of

remain
treacherous

His
prominent
role
put
him
in
the
awkward
position
of

on

his

be
most
dependent
in
the

ahead

At
this
stage
some

just
``
walk
away
''
from

where
the

exceeds

.

And
Friday
the
13th
notwithstanding
,
stocks
have
been
this

hot

.

I
have
even
more

I

Peter
was
sad
because
Jesus
asked
him
three
times
,
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''

As
a
result
,
his
calligraphy
came
to
combine
fluid
grace
with

also
have
recorded
some
slippage
in

In
looking
at
these
and
other
policies
,
I
learn
to
ask
pointed
questions
about
some
of
the
assumptions
built
into
``
policy
illustrations
''--
the
rows
of
numbers
that
show
me

The

's
smooth
absorption
eased
fears
that

would
overwhelm

traders
said
.

You
said
that

I
already

If

I
felt

glanced
at

Outside

,
I
joined
a
chatty
,
eclectic
crowd
of
Americans
:
a
retired
hippie
turned
English
teacher
from
Vermont
;
a
woman
with
a
New

accent
who
struggled
through
the
narrow
eye
-
slit
in
her
black
veil
to
keep
track
of
her
hyperactive
daughter
;
a
white
-
bearded
man
in
a
Santa
hat
,
who
said
he
was
picking
up
his
passport
before
returning
to
the
North
Pole

But
I
am
never
really
alone

the
Father

That
irritates
many

taken
their

They

Discussing

Mr.

he
did

been
clearly

The

attacked
the

The

over
where

it

how
to
ensure
that
it

right

we
found
out

Since
Judas
was
the
one
in

,
some
of
them
thought
that
Jesus
meant
for
him
to
go
and
buy
some
things
they
needed

the
feast

The
law
also
prevents
Mr.

easing

I
think

Arthur

that
he
,
the

Then
he
broke
some

gave
it
to
them

His
own
account
of
the
situation
is
that
the
gangs
are
fighting
it
out
over
casino
profits
,
but
that
this
does
n't
affect
the
lives
of
ordinary
people

you

Today

what
exactly
does
it
mean

Now

[qqtlbos]
:
Three
and
a
half
hours
ago
,
I
learned
my
bf
's
father
has
already
been
remarried
for
several
days
.

He
did
this
because
the
bronze
altar
in
front
of
the
Lord
was
too
small
to
hold
them
all
.

As
the
Scriptures
say
,
``
Those
who
gathered
much
did
not
have
too
much
,

shopping
center
's
parking
lot
,
and
one
could
be
in
the
safe
,
busy
mall
of
a
prosperous
suburb
.

And
I
think
that
it
really
contains
a
very
important
lesson
for
us
in
that
we
really
need
to
pay
close
attention
not
to
just
broad
questions
like
elections
but
specifically
the
law
in
countries
like
this
.

and
we
had
such
a
good

So
,
it
appears
that
it
is
still
not
bad
in
gaining

it
does
achieve

But
Jesus
said
to
him
,

said

things

So
%um
I
said
so
let
me
understand
this

That
's
the
highest
estimate
for
a
single
collection
in
auction
history
.

In
only
one
presidential
election
year
prior

did
more
than
20

In

sentiment

fizzled

many

analysts
say
a

sell

off
probably
wo
n't
occur

the

And
why
did
n't
they
do
so
,
if
they
were
telling
the
truth
?
Especially
since
private
as

is
n't
enough

To
ask

gave
Russia
the
Chishima
Islands
and
the
southern
part
of
Sakhalin
Island
,
which
Japan
occupied
at
the
time
.

It
is
still
our
assessment
that
such
an
agreement
is
possible
within
the
framework
of
what
we
call
in
a
generic
name
,
Camp
David

Dark
hints
would
be
raised
that
parts
of
the
administration
hope
Mr.
Gorbachev
would
fail
,
just
as
they
were
when
Vice
President
Quayle
voiced
similar
sentiments
.

To
that
end
,
Yugoslavia
will
be
a
trustful
neighbor
and
a
conscientious
member
of
the
international
community
and
will
invest
its
best
efforts
to
promote
peace
and
stability
in
the

In

Some

claim
to
be

then
the

thing
that

all
the

Then
Jesus
helped
the

understand
these
Scriptures
about
him
.

What
brought
the
naval
issue
to
a
head
is
that
the
Crusaders
are
literally
falling
apart
,
without
any

replace
them

Only
God
is
important

because

It

not

I
always
thought
the

I

This
is
what

it

up
to

officially
clear

clear

his
satirical
jabs

sharp

The

the

he
told

advised
him
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial

declined

190
points
late
that
afternoon
,
and
cheerfully
informed
him
that
he
and
his
fellow

were
to
blame
.

He
lived
among
people
,
observing
their
daily
lives
to
gather
information
for
the
purpose

enriching
his
studies

The

show
they

Even

they
quite
clearly
stand

time
the

think

Then
some
problems
appeared
,
which
are
not

and
I
can
say
them
clearly
.

``

Mr.
Pyszkiewicz
says
as
his

Wieslawa
,
sets
some
chairs
out
in
the
sun
.

Well
I
think
clearly
we
've
got
to
act
.

After
that
,
we
who
are
still
alive
at
that
time
will
be
gathered
up
with
those
who
have
died
.

The
classroom
itself
operated
on
the
periphery
of
this
awful
system
,
discipline
collapsed
,
and

stopped

Even

was

After

came
into

Since

merely
narrows
the
gap

it
ca
n't
add

In

there
were
people
in

celebration
for

but
Mao

steadfastly
refused

But
even
those

anticipation
of
being
transferred

in

age

then
you
've
got
to
have
a
handle
on
some
key
points
.

We
'll
leave
them
alone
.

The
last
time
presidential
candidates
had
that
luxury
was
in
1960
--
Richard
Nixon
and
John
F.
Kennedy
facing
off
over
a
$
300
million
surplus
,
not
adjusted
for
inflation
.

I
mean
there
's
like
over
two
million
almost
three
million
books
in
the
library
and
stuff
like
that

It
assessed
nearly
$
500,000
against
a
cruise

ship
company
that
carried
about
100
deckhands
,
cooks
,
bartenders
,
entertainers
and
other
employees
as
self

employed
independents
.

and
his
privacy
has
been
violated
.

His
mother
was
Maacah
daughter
of
King
Talmai
of
Geshur
.

And
lawmakers
are
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
a
compromise
that
would
give
the
Air
Force
nearly
all
of
the
$
2.4
billion
it
wants
for
production
of
Northrop
Corp.
's
radar
-
eluding
B
-
2
bombers
,
which
cost
$
530

apiece

I
did
not
know
where
they

from

where

The

calls

coordination
between
Finnair

similar
alliance
last

Thus
,
they
say
,
futures
inhibit
the
basic
purpose
of
the
stock
market
:
to
accurately
price
securities
so
that
capital
and
investment
flows
where
it
's
needed
most

the

siphoned

Mexico

97

I
hope
now

in
the
aftermath
of
the
statements
by

that

will
change

But
in

the

would
say
that

does
not
at
all
mean
renouncing
virtue
,
and
it
does
not
mean
candor
and
challenging
values
and
morals

therefore
usually
most

are

recalled
the

appeared
at
home

But
there

signs
that

could
change
the
politics
of
health

care
legislation
and
the
economics
of
medicine

This
meeting

Let
's
look
at
some
of
the
other
stories
that
are
making
headlines
right
now
.

20
million
years
ago
,
they
were
formed
when
India
broke
off
what
was
then
a
piece
of
Africa
and
slammed
into
that
portion
of
Asia
,
creating
this
tremendous
mountain
range
,
with
of
course
Mt.
Everest
at
29,000
feet
above
sea
level

They
still

what
that
meant

Analysts
say
Fed
policy
makers
have
been
wary
of
relaxing
credit

they

be
careful
everywhere

he
put
off
a
firm
decision

his

searched
for
a
compromise
that
would
tighten
requirements
for
such
abortions
in
a
way
acceptable
to
the
president
.

You
will
make
them
able
to
understand
the
truth

but
my
own
views
reflect
uh
those
of
the
President
on
this
matter
..

and
you
know
all
these
Arabs
started
coming
out
and
helping
us

The
Arab
peninsula
is
characterized
by
a
great
deal
of
tribal
variety
and
each
of
these
tribes
has
its
own
way
of
receiving
guests

preparing
feasts

That
is

it
is
from
the
perspective
of

that
it
looks
at
the
war
or
also
looks
at
major
events

accounts

this

is
estimated
to
reach
18

increasing
by
approximately
25

As

The

see
the

However

Jesus
knew
what
the
Pharisees
were
thinking
.

By
law
,
the
trust
must
pay
out
5
%
of
its
taxable
income
each
year
and
that
,
in
turn
,
creates
big
dividends
.

They
carried
the
news
to
the
Philistines
and
to
all
the
temples
of
their
idols
.

The
enemy
attacked
several
times
,
and
each
time
they
were
repelled
.

Moreover
,
after
deducting
the
cost
of
imported
raw
materials
etc.
,
the
textile
industry
is
Taiwan
's
biggest
foreign
currency
earner
,
bringing
in
over
US$
10
billion
each
year

She
says
on
Election
Day
,
exit
polls
in
the
state
indicated
voters
chose
Al
Gore
,
and
now
it
's
time
to
see
if
that
's
true
,
but
not
everyone
appreciated
what
she
had
to
say
.

and
,
yeah
,
we
were
just
talking
about
you

The
answer
to
failure
is
not
to
perpetuate
it
.

The
sinful
self
wants
what
is
against
the
Spirit
,
and
the
Spirit
wants
what
is
against
the
sinful
self
.

people
whose
costs
include
supporting
the
Dulles
Toll
road
are
also
supporting
the
transit
that
will
make
it
possible
for
future

to
live
in

friendly
neighborhoods

They
note

Fox
believes
that
in
20
or
30
years
the
United
States
,
Canada
and
all
of
Latin
America
should
be
one
unified
market
,
much
in
a
way
that
the
European
Community
is
unified
,
and
so
Fox
is
going
to
use
his
marketing
sensibility
to
try
to
convince
the
American
people
that
this
is
the
way
to
go
.

As
Mr.
Noriega
's
political
troubles
grew
,
so
did
his
offers
of
assistance
to
the
Contras
,
an
apparent
attempt
to
curry
more
favor
in
Washington
.

And
he
says
he
's
learned
a
lesson
:
``
You
always
have
to
watch
out
for
yourself
.

Give
each
other
the
special
greeting
of
God
's
people
.

And
who
was
God
angry
with
for
40
years
?

When

I

what

is
that

Mr.

was
hesitant
to
read
too
much
into

but
he
said
,
``
It

In
addition
,
from
the
perspective
of
the
foreign
ministry
,
efforts
to
re-enter
the
UN
are
not
only
excellent
training

A

After
talking
on
and
off
for
the
past
four
weeks
,
Mr.
Roman
said
,
he
agreed
to
take
the
job
because
``
it
's
the
right
time
,
it
's
a
terrific
opportunity

I
think
I
leave
the
company

but
I
just
talked
to
her

The
economic
growth
in
future
will
be
realized
primarily
through
technological
advancement
and
social
harmony
.

The
issue
has
assumed
some
of
the
character
of
past
civil
-
rights
debates
and
reopens
old
regional
divisions
in
the
Democratic
majority
.

In
the
past
,
when
foreign
companies
would
release
men
's
and
women
's
fashion
lines
at
the

time
,
Taiwan
importers
would
only
bring
in
the
women
's
clothing
;
now
men
's
and
women
's
attire
comes
in
together
.

The
plan
thus
places
a
large
new
affirmative
-
action
program
,
based
on
``
socioeconomic
disadvantage
,
''
on
top
of
the
existing

After

his

at

a

in

stood
up

told
him
:
"
I

But

it
's
all
about
how
you
feel
about

inside

During
the
six
years
from
1992

,
foreign

back

This
has
been
opposed
by
the
Liberal

all

The
Fed
is
easily
assigned
the
blame
for
unpleasantness
,
like
high
interest
rates
or
slow
economic
growth

the

And
the
fact
that

showing
us
that

these

do
what

do

that
is

age

they

and
that
these

can
reverse
that
,
it
just
means
we
have
that

31st

The
opposition
has
recommended
that
elections
be
set
for
May
.

They
were
president
because
they
were
powerful
,
not
powerful
because
they
were
president
.

Which
brings
up
the
worst
and
meanest
ghost
of
all
--
the
ghost
of
the
shah
of
Iran
.

A
unified
system
of
taxation
should
be
introduced
rapidly
.

One
is
whether
there
is
any
secret
being
divulged
,
and
the
other
is
whether
the
news
that
Bush
wanted
to
bomb
al

TV
station
is
true
.

When
the
judge
bought
his
new
Sunbird
from
James
E.
Black
Pontiac

Cadillac
in
Ebensburg
five
years
ago
,
the
dealership
had
``
certain
apprehensions
''
about
the
judge
's
reputation
,
according
to
the
grand
-
jury
report
.

One
executive
familiar
with
the
Bloomingdale
's
situation
said
,
``
No
book
has
been
issued
regarding
Bloomingdale
's
,
there
are
no
projections
,
so
I
doubt
very
much
whether
any
bid
has
been
made
.
''

It
would
benefit
Japan
.

One
of
them
standing
trial
is
accused
of
serving
as
Bin

's
personal
secretary
.

And
Mr.
Straszheim
conceded
after
a
recent
drop
in
manufacturing
jobs
that
``
it
may
prove
to
be
the
case
that
we
got
whipsawed
--
that
we
pulled
the
recession
forecast
at
just
the
wrong
time
.
''

But
it
showed
strength
throughout
the
session
,
hitting
a
low
of
only
2102.2
within
the
first
few
minutes
of
dealings
.

But
now
,
as
for
the
various
companies
,
they
are
competing
against
each
other
,
ah
,
and
it
is
really
intense
.

I
did

I
had
to
come
back

because
I
was
going
to
call
you
at

Without

and
without

this

The

Joseph
.

Uh
let
's
start
with
John
King
from
DC
with
breaking
news
on
the
election
results
.

Here
's
how
the
network
covered
the
incidents
in
this
translated
report
.

He
was
a
leper
until
the
day
he
died
.

Egon
Krenz
,
the
man
tapped
yesterday
to
become
East
Germany
's
new
leader
,
faces
the
same
task
that
has
fallen
to
neighboring
socialist
colleagues
:
reforming
a
country
in
crisis
.

Then
,
if
you
find
that
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
,
they
can
be
special
servants
.

During
the
balloting
,
26
members
of
the
500

seat
Parliament
voted
against
Krenz
,
a
move
considered
unprecedented
in
the
country
's
40
-
year
history
.

It
was
the
first
time
Israeli
lawmakers
had
assembled
since
the
Palestinian
uprising
began
a
month
ago
.

This
is
the
suggestion
put
forward
by
Soviet
side
in
Polish
-
Soviet
negotiations
being
held
in

concerning
issues
of
the
Soviet
Union
withdrawing
troops
from
Poland
and
Russia

Then
Jesus
asked
the
people
,
``
Which
is
the
right
thing
to
do
on
the
Sabbath
day
:
to
do
good
or
to
do
evil
?

Though
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
such
a
situation
would
be
stable
,
for
those
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
current
choices
and
who
want
a
reshuffling
of
party
politics
in
Taiwan
,
this
is
the
opportunity
to
create
a
fresh
climate
.

We
believe
that
Jesus
died
,
but
we
also
believe
that
he
rose
again

,
exchanging

The

And
you

Do
you
still

And
you
are
listening

someone
greater

you

Well

there

the

It

eliminated

now
I
am
amazed
that
you
are
already
turning
away

believing
something
different

the
Good

It
's
a
miracle
she
survived

The
malaise
has
created
a
nostalgic
longing
for
the
uncomplicated
days
of
the
mid-1980s

before

firm
mergers

said
,
``
I
do

I
do
have
something

can
give
you

An

So
what
else
to
tell
you

Because
when
there
is
no
gravity
as
there
is
on
Mars
,
the
body
does
n't
pick
up
the
calcium
in
the
bones
,
so
it
does
n't
keep
getting
the
bones
stronger
and
stronger
,
so
they
will
just
lose
it

To
my
mind
it
was
totally
uninteresting
,
I
just
felt
these
middle

aged
women
were
extremely
suspicious
,
and
I
could
n't
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
over
that
woman
.

The
five
Philistine
rulers
watched
the
people
of
Beth
Shemesh
do
this
and
then
went
back
to
Ekron
that
same
day
.

When
the
other
Philistines
saw
their
hero
was
dead
,
they
turned
and
ran
.

But
most
of
them
could
have
afforded
to
keep
up
their
payments

they
chose
not
to
do
so

was

insensible

With

effort
of
people
around
the
world
,
countless
lives
have
been
promptly
saved
and
homeless
victims
have
been
initially
placed
.

In
my
opinion
,
the
real
star
of
the
gathering
was
not
Bush
Sr.
,
nor
Gerhard
Schroeder
,
the
former
German
Chancellor
whom
we
met
and
heard
in
Dubai
three
years
ago
when
he
was
still
in
the
Chancellery

The
U.S.

Uh
it
would
have
been
a

better
idea
for
the
administration
to
give
the
senators
on

Foreign
Relations
Committee
the
information
they
said
they
needed
and
I
think
they
were
right
uh
before

they
could
vote
on
the

Bolton

But
the
more
she
saw
of
life
,
the
more
dissatisfied
she
felt
with
her
own
situation
,
and
hoped
she
could
make
a
new
breakthrough
.

I
pointed
out
in
another
post
the
problems
of
planned
communities
.

Uh
actually
first
let
me
go
to
Joe
Tackapena
on
that
.

Annan
said
the
peace
accord
requires
the
UN
to
provide
help
in
all
levels
of

peace
process
,
including
immediately
taking
steps
to
control
arms
and
the
movements
of
militants
within
Nepal
's
border
,
as
well
as
providing
assistance
for

The
new
reports
of
sluggishness
,
which
were
foreshadowed
by
an
earlier
Labor
Department
report
that
manufacturing
payrolls
dropped
by
105,000
in
September
,
give
the
Fed
another
reason
to
further
ease
its
grip
on
credit
and
lower
interest
rates
.

Back
to
something
Kelly
Wallace
said
.

The
IRS
had
demanded
$
90
million
but
Mr.
Hunt
would
agree
to
no
more
than
$
60
million

He
was
stronger
than
she
was
,
so
he
forced
her
to
have
sexual
relations
with
him

because
we
're
being
recorded
.

Well
,
just
recently
,
it
's
needless
for
us
to
say
,
er
,
that
Japan
's
relations
,
we
can
say
,
with
its
neighboring
countries
this
year
have
suffered
overall
deterioration
.

but
still
I
looked
on
the
,

The
servant
said
,
``
I
think
I
saw
you
with
him
in
the
garden
!
''

I
can
say
that
coordination
was
not
sufficiently
adequate
.

The
revival
of
the
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduit
market
reflected
the
relative
calm
in
the
mortgage
market
after
two
days
of
volatile
trading
.

Moreover
,
a
recent
government
report
showing
widespread
layoffs
in
manufacturing
had
contributed
to
perceptions
that
the
manufacturing
sector
of
the
economy
had
slowed
to
a
crawl
.

It
's
not
going
to
happen
.

``
No
matter
how
competent
and
smart
you
both
are
,
the
relationship
almost
certainly
will
erode
if
you
do
n't
have
time
to
talk
,
to
have
fun
and
to
be
sexual
,
''
says
Ms.
Shaevitz
.

Now
time
is
different
,
and
the
diet
pattern
has
also
changed
.

The
Federal
Highway
Administration
has
an
emergency
relief
program

damaged

natural
disasters

wo
n't

said
these
things

very
troubled

So
we
actually
took
the

tried

one
way
to

serve
this
cause
,
and
since
these
interviews
came
through
the
newspaper

,
I
think
that
if
they
had
been
published
by
the
newspaper
Al
-
Watan
or
Al
-
Riyadh
they
would
have
stopped
this
question
from
being
asked
to
the
guest
because
they
are
known
for
their
banning
of
the
other
and
they
do
not
know
neutrality
when
exposing
and
they
do
not
like
these
answers
.
As
it
happened
with
the
newspaper
Al

it
halted

concealed

the
overwhelming

if

the

to

country
's
15
republics
``
does
n't
reflect
the
radical
changes
in
the
Soviet
federation
.
''

He
prayed
to
the
Lord
and
said
,
``
I
pray
that
you
will
cause
these
people
to
become
blind
.
''

There
are
uh
state
and
local
races
with
nationally
known
faces
and
issues
as
well
as
a
celebrity
or
two
.

However
,
as
Lin
grew
up
,
her
mother
would
call
her
and
the
other
girls
to
her
side
to
watch
and
help
out.

But
God
does
not
forget
any
of
them
.

We
will
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
that
he
makes
his
court
date
there
.

So
the
old
prophet
buried
the
body
.

In
the
end
,
later
,
did
we
say
anything
later
?

Although
Mr.
Brawer
's
appointment
as

was
long

,
the

then

Because
the

an
effective

of
13.4
%
when
it
was
issued
in
1984
,
and
interest
rates
in
general
had
declined
sharply
since
then
,
part
of
the
price
Dr.
Blumenfeld
paid
was
a
premium
--
an
additional
amount
on
top
of
the
CD
's
base
value
plus
accrued
interest
that
represented
the
CD
's
increased
market
value

In
the
past
few
days
,
branches
from
the
white
magnolias
planted
in
Shanghai
's
Botanical
Garden
have
sprouted
a
large
numbers
of
buds
,
some
have
opened
into
white
or
purple
flowers
,
forming
a
wonderful
scene
of
flowers
and
leaves
existing
together
.

It
's
the
most
stunning
example
of
Las
Vegas
's
concerted
effort
to
transform
itself
into
a
world
-
famous
vacation
resort
for
families
as
well
as
gamblers
.

But
I
want
you
to
understand
this
:
The
head
of
every
man
is
Christ

Commerzbank

That
is
,
the
one
who
hired
them

for
something
in
his
mind
-
brought
them
more
than
one
hour
before
the
first
match
of
the
Iraqi
team
against
the
Bahraini
team
,
and
they
did
not
leave
the
stadium
until
after
the
match
between
Saudi
Arabia
and
Qatar
.

Also
,
the
earth
shook

Menna

Then
he
went

other

in

As

result
,
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
countervailing
pressure
against
radical

Thanks
for
that
Dan
.

So
I
think
what
I
'm
going
to
do
is
%um
,

Corporate
pride
as
well
as
the
close
ties
common
among
Japanese
manufacturers
help
explain
why.

If
construction
had
been
strictly
carried
out
according
to
reinforcement
specifications
,
such
serious
widespread
collapsing
should
not
have
occurred
.

``
A
lot
of
people
would
like
to
go
back
to
1970
,
''
before
program
trading
,
he
said
.

The
vast
majority
of
them
,
however
,
were
wiped
out
by
a
succession
of
environmental
upheavals
that
were
too
sudden
and
catastrophic
for
the
normal
rules
of
natural
selection
to
operate
.

I
want
the
men
everywhere
to
pray
.

But
there
are
grounds
for
complaint
.

Japanese
demand
grew
by
70
%
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
and
the
nation
plans
an
issue
of
a
silver
commemorative
coin
that
will
require
4.5
million
ounces
.

It
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
likely
to
be
enacted
,
however
.

An
FBI
team
is
heading
to
Saudi
Arabia
to
help
investigate
the

Then
they
will
pray
toward
this
place
and
praise
your
name
.

Judging
from
the
information
in
the
study
,
"
income
gap
"
has
been
considered
the
most
serious
problem
in
social
development
.

Rather
,
it
's
a
device
that
could
send
shock
waves
through
the
president
's
entire
relationship
with
Democrats
and
Republicans
alike
in
Congress
,
fundamentally
enhance
the
power
of
the
presidency
and
transform
the
way
the
government
does
its
business
.

Their
reason
for
doing
it
is
wrong
.

Akayev
also
highly
esteemed
the
fruitful
co-operation
between
the
scientists
and
technicians
of
the
two
countries
.

After

Trying
to
deliver
a
verdict
on
the
Cultural
Revolution
whilst
in
a
parochial
and
emotional
frame
of
mind
is
incredibly
frivolous
,
incredibly
flippant
and
it
will
certainly
not
stand
up
to
the
test
of
time
,
and
will
be
laughed
at
.

The
company
already
is
gearing
up
for
a
renaissance
of
nuclear
power
even
though
it
has
n't
received
an
order
for
a
domestic
nuclear
plant
in
a
decade
.

This
is
the
Good
News
that
I
tell
people
.

As
for
the
United
States
,
this
will
augur
low
exchange
rates
for
the
U.S.
dollar
,
and
an
expansion
of
effective
interest
rates
on
U.S.
-
dollar
capital
.

Why
do
you
believe
that
the
leaders
involved
need
to
take
responsibility
for
this
?

and
these
are
cops
who
literally
slept
in
their
car
for
twenty
four
hour
shifts
.

But
they
are
just
adding
more
and
more
sins
to
the
ones
they
already
have
.

The
United
States
has
thus
been
deliberately
unclear
-
it
does
not
exclude
Taiwan
from
the
TMD
,
but
it
has
not
clearly
said
that
Taiwan
would
be
included
.

A
Temple
-
Inland
spokesman
said
the
company
expects
record
earnings
in
1989
,
and
``
we
're
still
pretty
bullish
''
on
1990
.

The
quake
and
baseball
were
n't
related
,
unlike
the
massacre
of
athletes
that
attended
the
1972
Olympics
.

that
's
right
.

Granting

and
you
talk
uh
and
hold
babies
and
talk
with
the
people
who
are
taking
care
of
them
.

With
my
own
eyes
,
I
saw
one
of
them
with
the
lower
part
of
her
abdomen
revealed
out
of
increased
enthusiasm
!!

Well
she
's
an
adorable
woman
.

And
how
can
any
employee
with
a
salary
that
's
barely
enough
to
live
on
cope
with
these
unjustified
increases
?

A
Democrat
,
he
has
praised
him
on
his
work
on
Medicare
reform

George
Bush
's
continued
support
of
the
tax
dam
sustains
this
strategy
of
pressuring
Congress
to
make
choices
among
competing
priorities
,
rather
than
just
saying
yes
to
all
the
grateful
special

interest
constituencies
that
fill
the
PAC
trough
.

He
said
Drexel
--
the
leading
underwriter
of
high
-
risk
junk
bonds
--
could
no
longer
afford
to
sell
any
junk
offerings
if
they
might
later
become
troubled
because
Drexel
risked
losing
its
highly
lucrative
junk
franchise
.

He
became
angry
in

For
this
,
the
Chinese
government
views
with
extreme
importance
and
actively
participates
in
international
population
activities
,
and
sincerely
hopes
that
the
international
community
will
adopt
a
stand
of
realistic
resolution
of
population
and
development
problems
,
seeking
similarities
while
accommodating
differences
,
co-operating
closely
to
strive
hard
together
towards
a
stable
world
population
to
create
a
beautiful
future
!

But
,
having
reviewed
the
past
,
Chia
Chen

i
declares
:
"
In

there

Ho

only
after

This
mincemeat
of
tiny
gridlocked
squares
was
inspired
by
the
artist
's
own
digs
:
``
My

Suddenly
,
George
Bush
the
pro-choice
advocate
became
George
Bush
the
anti-abortionist
.

He
gave
up
everything
so
that
you
could
be
richly
blessed
.

For
example
,
a
House
-
Senate
conference
ostensibly
increased
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
budget
for
construction
of
facilities
to
nearly
$
592
million
,
or
more
than
$
200
million
above
what
either
chamber
had
previously
approved
.

The
jailer
said
to
Paul
,
``
The
officials
have
sent
these
soldiers
to
let
you
go

and
then
it
's
behind

We
have
a
household
where
we
talk
about
our
feelings
and
make
sure
that
no
one
is
afraid
to
speak
of
what
's
going
on.

Then
,
you
shake
it
,
and
you
hear
a
cracking
sound
on
the
ground
;
hey
,
scalded
lice
.

But
later
in
the
day
,
a
report
by
the
Purchasing
Management
Association
of
Chicago
cast
doubt
on
the
recession
scenario
.

My
brothers
and
sisters
,
I
pray
that
the
grace
of
our
Lord
Jesus
Christ
will
be
with
your
spirits

A

said
,
``
Absolutely

``

I

The

I

is
a
change

We

that

,
if

The

Rafael

renewed
his

full
authority
,
and
opposed
the
currently
stalled
negotiations
for

a

And
the
people
who
believe
will

do
these

They

But
that
's

A
few
months
ago
,
Iran
was
a
symbol
of
resistance
,
jihad
,
dignity
,
and
challenge
,
thanks
to
its
support
of
Arab
resistance
movements
like
Hezbollah
in
Lebanon
and
Hamas
in
Palestine
,
while
the
popularity
of
the
Arab
regimes
was
hitting
rock
bottom
.

However
,
if
they
can
also
interpret
those
languages
,
they
are
as
important
as
the
one
who
prophesies
.

``
That

At

But
small

business
lobbyists
say
they
support
the
idea

included
in
the
Kennedy

Waxman
bill
,
of

laws
or
regulations
requiring
greater
use
of
community
rating
,
which
pegs
rates
to
the
use
of
health
care
by
a
community
or
other
large
group

designed
to
prevent

Also
,
a

In

up

security

arrested
scores

Whether

The
main
advantage
of
a

is
that
it

therefore

The
situation
was
like
that
of

is
thrown
slightly
off

by
an

But
I

I

Yet
the
ongoing
investigation
with
Mansour
and
his
assistants
did
not
reach
a
reliable
criminal
connection
between
the
assassination
attempt
on
President
Al
Gemayel
and
his
son
Pierre
,
which
was
postponed
for
reasons
beyond
their
control
in
the
North
,
and
the
assassination
crime
that
was
committed
in
New
Jadida
on
the
morning
of
a
party
tour
by
Minister
Al
Gemayel
of
the
northern
party
members
,
which
was
described
as
having
achieved
excellent
results
.

Also
,
difficulties
in
communication
between
grandparents
and
grandchildren
frequently
arise
because
of
the
very
different
modes
of
expression
employed
by
each
.

In
the
past
,
the
definition
of
"
a
real
man
"
was
usually
one
who
could
support
a
wife

children
,
and
who
would
play
the
active
role
in
a
relationship
,
with
the
woman
being
the
passive
partner

One
reason
for

that

Well

that
's
a

his

said
that
1997
was
the
first
year
of
economic
growth
for
those
countries
with
transitioning
economies
since
they
had
stopped
implementing
centrally
planned
economies
,
the
rate
reaching
1.7
%
,
and
estimated
to
grow
by
3.25
%
for
1998
.

Christ
also
did
this
so
that
the
non-Jewish
people
could
praise
God
for
the
mercy
he
gives
to

Not
selling
into
a
panic
turned
out
to
be
very
good
advice
:
Despite
the
market
's
volatility
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
has
surged
114
points
in
the
past
four
days
.

Technically
speaking
,
they
are
extremely
well
done
.

Unlike
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
where
buyers
and
sellers
are
quickly
matched
,
the
junk
market
,
where
risky
corporate
loans
are

,
is
sometimes
closed
for

Were
the

really
so
tall

Compared
with
the
two

dimensional
versions
they
lose
their
satirical
edge
,
but
gain
in
playful
appearance
.

If
your
gift
is
speaking
,
your
words
should
be
like
words
from
God
.

Then
they
will
become
strong
in
the
faith
,
and
they
will
stop
paying
attention
to
the
stories
told
by
those
Jews
.

I
think
it
's

Later
,
no

one

But
I
tell
you
,
Elijah
has
already
come

Before
the
end
comes
,
the
Good
News

be
told
to
all
nations

In
this
editorial
,
it
mentioned
,
uh
,
saying
that
the
entire
international
community
is
earnestly
anticipating
that
the
six
party
talks
could
resume
.

just
everybody
talking
about
it

Now
this
is
the
first
nomination
to
have
been
even
mildly
controversial
,
but
it
does
go
a
long
way
to
satisfy
the
conservative
wing
of
Mr.
Bush
's
party
.

And
the
elders
bowed
down
and
worshiped
.

And
so
I
really
have
no
idea
to
tell
you
the
truth

Amid

he
said
:
"
What
further
dangerous

Lebanon
to
realize
the
magnitude

harm
that
has
been
done
so
far
,
and
which
could
take
a
more
explosive
bent
if
they
do
not

the

and
return
immediately
to

and
without

accounts
only
for
approximately
5

whose
increased

at

the
advice
of

found
that
since

As
a
result
,
GOP
state
Rep.
Stephen
Freind
of
Delaware
County
,
the
legislature
's
leading
foe
of
abortion
,
has
been
given
all
but
free
rein
to
press
a
strict
seven
-
point
plan
to
restrict
abortion
and
,
he
hopes
,
to
force
the
Supreme
Court
directly
to
reassess
its
1973
Roe
v.
Wade
decision
that
established
the
right
of
abortion
in
the
first
place
.

Then
David
went
to
Baal
Perazim
and
defeated
the
Philistines
in
that
place
.

The
announcement
fueled
speculation
for
future
advances
in

It
expects
any
impact
on

business
to
be
slight

Japan
has
been
testing
imported
food
from
Europe
since
the
April
1986
Chernobyl
accident
in

the
spokesman
said
.

That
is
typically
about
a
three
-
week
window
.

at
which
he
looked
at
me
really
funny
and
said
'
er
,
fifty
bucks
'.

This
coincided
with
the
postponement
of
talks
relating
to

being
imposed
on
Iran
following
Russia
's
dissatisfaction
with
the
situation
in
Belarus
at

We

In

in
terms
of
industrial
structure
,
the
developed
countries
have
currently
walked
out
of
the

the

The
focuses
of

:
the

that
various
places
should
broadcast
TV
dramas
revolving
around
the
main

a
restriction
on
the
freedom
of
radio

,
as
well
as
interference
with
public
entertainment
orientation
using
the
administrative
power
;
what
on

are
the
subjects
that
belong
to
the
main

and
what
the
main

should
represent
.

All

They

Fear

:

I
did

Well
,
it
now
turns
out
that
Mrs.

had
to
travel
across

summit
in
Kuala

discomfit
the
Holy
Order

Um
how
old
are
the
children
?

And
now
many
enemies
of
Christ
are
already
here

Quite
apart
from
the
difficulties
of
keeping
his
family
fed
,
he
often
was
n't
even
sure
how
old
his
three
children
were
and
what
year
of
school
they
were
in
.

There
were
also
gun
battles
near
Jerusalem
.

For
such
an
accusation
to
come
from
the
Green
Zone
at
Sheikh
Harith
is
no
strange
matter
,
but
for
it
to
come
from
the
President
of
the
Republic
of
Iraq
-
this
is
indeed
strange
and
objectionable
.

But
if
you
really
believe
that
the
only
thing
that
happened
on
September
eleventh
was
people
flew
airplanes
into

I
think
you
have
a
very
narrow
view
of

we

was
out
there

'm
convinced
that
we
could
solve

you
come

it
also

far

2.7

raised
on

market

For
the

,
it
has
become
a
highly
volatile
political
issue

we
refuse

idea
of

child

as

required
-
yuppie

possession

motivating
them
,
since
the
wealthy
offspring
of
their
friends
are
shown
to
be
rude
brats
,
in
therapy
by
age
five
.

The
report
also
pointed
out
,
due
to
the
technological
development
and
the
rise
in
productivity
,
the
possibility
that
China
will
continue
to
maintain
an
economic
growth
rate
of
8
%
to
10
%
in
the
next
10

very
great

annul
this

Revelation

new
year

little
earlier

extensively

light

where
God
is

At

there
has
been
a
big
increase
in

monthly
rent
of

when

Is
the
trouble
over
?

A
metric
ton
is
equal
to
2,204.62
pounds
.

It
's
a
very
frightening
prospect
.

270
people
were
killed
when
the
jet
went
down
over
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
,
in
1988
.

But
even
that
brings
Nissan
only
to
the
share
it
had
in
1987
,
and
leaves
the
company
behind
its
high
of
5.5
%
in
1980
and
1982
.

Now
there
are
23

Timothy
,
God
has
trusted
you
with
many
things

Lloyd
's
is
moving
forward
on
some
fronts
,
though
.

As
he
sees
it
,
since
currently
there
are
three
candidates
with
a
roughly
equal
share
of
the
vote
,
whoever
wins
will
probably
not
get
more
than
50
%
.

You
know
,
He
still
had

we
're
not

They
must
rely
on
themselves
and
liberate
themselves
in
order
to
achieve
it
,
and
need
not
any
other
people
to
"
care
for
the

This

in

entrance
examination

,
having
an

he
was
admitted
by

and
I
said
no
this
is
it
.

The
difficulty
of
using
stamps
for
the
general
public
is
a
major
sticking
point
.

He
is
currently
experiencing
what
it
's
like
to
have
the
phrase
,
``
under
investigation
for
scientific
fraud
,
''
also
attached
to
his
name
.

He
thought
the
comrades
at
the

were
very
considerate
and
thoughtful
for

who
believe
in

,
gay

,
people

It
was
the
possibility
of
this
demand
that
helped
firm
prices
,
the
analyst
said
.

Tell

Well
the
bottom
line
is
that
there
were
fifty
-
six
votes
for
cloture
.

Because
it
was
illegal
.

So
,
to
punish
false
news
,
some
practical
measures
must
be
taken
,
exposing
it
in
the
papers
is
very
effective
.

At
this
point
we
understand
that
there
are
some
problems
with
some

in

The

Actually
,
Ahithophel
's

good

they
said

only
problem
was
that
they

oh
I
think
it
was
my
fiftieth
high
school
reunion
early
June

The
American
Psychological
Association
produced
a
guide
called
"
The
Way
to
Flexibility
"
aimed
at
building
and
reinforcing
the
flexible
personality
and
training
people
wanting
to
attain
such
a
personality
easily
.

At
that
time
,
a
huge
amount
of
nylon
66
fiber
-
600
tonnes
per
month
-
was
used
by
the
local
textile
industry
in
the
manufacture
of
specialty
apparel
such
as
women
's
tights
,
swimwear
and
underwear
.

The
policy
was
contained
in
an
exchange
of
letters
last
October
between
the
Senate
intelligence

and
the
CIA

.

However
,
it
is
not
devoid
either
of
offences
or
negative
trends
regarding
the
Iraqi
course
and
the
review
of
the
Iraqi
crisis
issue
.

Having
been
through
several
tornadoes
and
hurricanes
,
I
have
a
different
perspective
.

They
also
want
Afghanistan
to
hand
over
the
Saudi
born
militant

Osama
Bin

While

also

And
in

's

close

has
been

for
him
throughout

The

But
even

he
has
shown
signs

the
indecisiveness

The
point
of
this
1955
novel
,
which
spawned
two
movies
,
is
that
the
soulless
pod

replicated

accuses

At

cocktail
party
,
ambassador
Cai
gave
a
warm
speech
to

always

undertaking

motherland

On
the
front

was
the
sign
for
the
twin

That
compares
with
58
%
of
the
similar
age
group
in
the
1980
through
1982
surveys
and
55
%
in
the
1972
through
1975
surveys
.

It
's
just
for
one
day
.

But
would
n't
it
be
more
efficient
and
effective
to
supply
such
support
to
the
stock
market
directly
?

Which
makes
the

necessary

His
comments

interpreted

A
man
with

was
arrested
outside

admits

And
they
say
these
experts
will
be
able
to
tell
how
long
the
body
had
been
in
there
and
if
the
remains
of

almost
full

After
a
wonderfully

Unless

In
1983

the

Court
tried
to
supply
a

definition
in
the

whether
the

had
breached
his

duty

obtain
``

They

much

But
not
long
after
men
were
intoxicated
by
their
victory
over
nature
,
they
came
to
the
realization
that
"
when
the
good
advances
by
one
step
,
its
evil
counterpart
will
advance
by
several
steps
.
"

in
other

there
was

value
of

was
8.52

US
dollars
,
accounting
for
46.4
%
of
the
total
imports
,
and
both
had
risen
compared
to
the

period

Brothers

good
way
before
God

King
Solomon
commanded
them
to
cut

some
of

I
saw
the
Spirit
come
down
from
heaven
like
a
dove
and
rest

No

The

CREATIVE
ACCOUNTING
,
mostly
by
conglomerates
,
forced
CPAs
to
change
their
way
of
setting

standards
that
had
become
all

flexible

We

Foreign

many
of

canceled

but
it
's
pretty
fun

Beginning
at
that
time
,
the
Qinglong
phenomenon
gradually
became
known
to
the
outside
.

El
Salvador
,
an
ROC
diplomatic
ally
in
Central
America
,
was
hit
on
January
13
by
an
earthquake
measuring
between
7.4
and
7.9
on
the
Richter
scale
.

But
I
tell
you
,
on
the
day
of
judgment
it
will
be
worse
for
you
than
for
Tyre
and
Sidon
.

That
evening
,
a
celebration
ceremony
with
the
theme
of
"
Share
Happiness

the
World
,
Sail
in
Qingdao
"
was
also
staged
at
the
gym
of
Qingdao
University
.

We
know
this
because
God
spoke
later
about
another
day
for
rest
.

The
people
of
Ziph
went
to
see
Saul
at
Gibeah
and
said
to
him
,
``
David
is
hiding
on
Hakilah
Hill
,
across
from
Jeshimon

And
this
is
what
we
pray

that
your

will
be
made
completely

So
it
's
entirely
possible
that

it
seems
in

turgid

It
felt
more
like

In

the

has
captured

Under

In

the

,
surprised
at
the
pressured
timing
to
disarm
the
resistance
.

And
the
simple
idea
of
having
a
little
oversight
uh
little
checks
and
balances
back
in
the
system
is
potentially
a
really
powerful
argument
for
Democrats

You

After
watching
the
New
Year
's
Spectacular
held
by
NTD
TV
,
I
had
a
feeling
that
I
have
n't
had
for
a
long
time
,

President
Bush
must
appoint
two
other
members
,
one
a
Democrat
and
one
a
Republican
.

Here
is
what
the
Sheikh
said
as
quoted
from
his
website
Islam
Today
:--

It
can
be
expected
that
neither
the
appreciation
of
RMB
nor
the
global
economic
recession
will
seriously
impact
Chinese
export
.

``
We
've
run
out
of
places
to
build
freeways
in
L.A.
,
and
the
only
place
to
go
is
up
,
''
Mr.
O'Connell
said
,
although
he
acknowledges
there
are
many
obstacles
,
including
cost
.

Since
the
spill
last
March
,
Exxon
and
the
state
have
been
wrangling
over
whether
spraying
dispersant
on
the
oil
in
the
first
hours
after
the
spill
,
when
the
weather
was
clear
and
calm
,
would
have
helped
limit
the
environmental
damage
.

Mr.
Bush
would
be
acting
in
the
public
interest
if
he
let
the
Washington
elites
who
manipulate
these
budgets
--
the
bureaucrats
,
the
lobbyists
,
the
congressional
staffers
--
live
for
just
one
year
on
a
restricted
diet

Life
when
you
're
sick
tastes
bitter
,
but
it
can
also
be
fun
if
you
're
lucky
enough
to
master
secrets
on
how
to
turn
the
bitter
into
fun
.

Tsai
Ing
-
wen
,
who
met
twice
with
Lee
during
his
brief
stay
,
added
that
Lee
has
considerable
political
stature
in
Asia
and
around
the
world
,
and
his
concern
about
cross-strait
relations
and
the
direction
of
policy
in
this
regard
is
helpful
to
Taiwan
.

And
he
is
the
one
who
makes
everything
agree
with
what
he
decides
and
wants
.

David
's
servants
asked
him
,
``
Why
are
you
doing
this
?

Probably
most
people
do
n't
realize
,
adds
Tsung

,
that
there
are
still
places
in
Taiwan
as
backward
as
Taihsi

What
Anonymous

n't
figured
out
yet

is
that
special

actively

Legislation
to
this
effect
has
been
introduced
in
Congress
in
this
session
by
Rep.
Stephen
Neal
D.
,
N.C
.

You

Maybe
he
did
n't
start
it
,
but
Mohandas
Gandhi
certainly
provided
a
recognizable
beginning
to
non-violent
civil
disobedience

we
know
it
today
.

He
killed

But
Christ
really
has
been
raised
from

--
the
first
one
of
all
those
who
will
be
raised

As

I
make
this
promise
to
you

It
can
be
said

The
seemingly
mundane
action
,
which
was
opposed
by
the
Securities
Industry
Association
,
a
trade
group
,
has
important
implications
for
banks
'
recent
entry
into
the
underwriting
of
corporate

.

I
am
not
the
first
to
propose
it
.

The
federation
said
Friday
that
it
regrets
the
resignation
,
but
issued
a
stinging
response
that
called
Exxon
a
``
corporate
pariah
''
that
should
keep
an
open
dialogue
with
environmentalists
.

They
'll

It
is
reported
that
the
Import
and
Export
Bank
of
China
will
also
soon
successively
sign
similar
trust
agency
agreements
with
other
commercial
banks
.

--
During
the
1970s
the
commercial
banks
lured
the
country
loan
business
away
from
the
bond
markets
where
the
discipline
of
a
prospectus
and
``
Use
of
Proceeds
''
confirmation
allowed
lenders
to
audit
expenditures
of
old
loans
before
new
loans
were
made
.

And
this
is
only
a
cut
-
and
-
dried
business
transaction
.

Probably
the
most
annoying

I
wanted
to
make

Taiwan

cut

According
to
a
report
in

Washington
Post
on
the
20th
,
during
an
interview
by
the
newspaper
on

acknowledged
for
the
first
time
that
the

I
would
never
think
that
he
would
do
anything
like
this
.

Here
's
what
he
said
in
1998
.

He
says
:
"
If
I
had
used
my
allowance
every
year
from
the
time
I
was
small
to
invest
in
a
fund
,
at
the
rate
of
NT$
30,000
per
year
,
after
20
years
,
there
would
be
quite
a
lot
of
money
right
now

"

That
's
really
funny
.

Still
other

alternative

After

Zheng

she
donated
the

Thank

I
was
born
for
this
:
to
tell
people
about
the
truth
.

Then
someone
decided
to
try
broken
-down
earthmoving
equipment
that
,
inexplicably
,
held
against
the
waves
.

Today
,
though
the
public
is
barely
aware
,
much
of
U.S.
industry
,
particularly
companies
manufacturing
or
selling
overseas
,
have
made

routine

And
while
the

Before

The

In

One

said
suddenly
they
start
going
into

frenzies
because
they
're
getting
polls
back
in
their
individual

that
are
starting
to
reflect
those
national
numbers
that
look
so
horrible
for
them
.

This
could
not
only
restore
the
relationship
between
fire

potter
,
but
could
also
induce
Taiwan

ceramic

-
among
whom
Cheng
believes
there
is
currently
too
much
division
and
distance
-
to
cooperate
with
each
other

They
worshiped
him
and
went

So
David

An

In

the

Does
that
mean
Shirl
Clay
?

so
he
does
n't

he
says
it

"
Executives
are
always
asking
questions
.

Let
the
president
demand
strict
new
ethics
rules
:
With
four
sitting
House
members
accused
of
sexual
misdeeds
,
amid
the
unfolding
HUD
scandal
and
after
the
Wright
debacle
,
``
people
are
slightly
dulled
by
scandal
,
''
says
political
humorist
Art
Buchwald
.

Following
the
welcoming
ceremonies
,
the
Guinean
president
shook
hands
with
those
receiving
him
,
led
by
Dr.
AhmedNazif
,
Prime
Minister
of
the
Cabinet
,
and
a
number
of
ministers
and
senior
statesmen
.

Although
analysts
do
n't
expect
the
Federal
Reserve
to
ease
credit
policy
soon
,
reports
like
those
yesterday
help
build
the
case
for
lower
rates
.

I
got
to
wrap
it
up.

The
Israelites
met
together
at
Mizpah

The
editor
also
says
the
new
producer
on

Bruce
Baird
,
told

to
screen
the

without
telling
stars
Sylvester
Stallone
and
Kurt
Russell
or
Mr.
Peters
.

Now
,
please
,
bless
my
family
.

But
they
must
also
assign
a
price
to
each
of
these
items
as
well
as
to

,

So
as
not

take
his
words
out

,
I
will
insofar
as

cite

I

But
Judas

Past
experience
has
shown
that
the
KMT
and
DPP
can
work
together
to
boycott
Executive
Yuan
proposals
;
if
they
do
this
to
a
Soong
-
led
executive
branch
,
this
could
lead
to
a
crisis
ending
in
either
a
vote
of
no
confidence
or
dissolution
of
the
parliament
.

That
group
is
led

Abu

The
world
had
a
big
yuk
recently
when
the
Soviets
reported
a
rash
of
UFO
landings
,
one
of
them
bringing
tall
aliens
who
glowed
in
the
dark
to
Voronezh

So
,
this
is
a
war
in
many
senses
and
the
Palestinians
are
shooting
at
our
soldiers
,
and
therefore
we
need
to
address
this
issue
not
as
a
civilian
uprising
,
but
as
a
military
confrontation
.

He

were
the

They
paid
the
soldiers
a
lot
of
money
and
said
to
them
,
``
Tell
the
people
that

'
followers
came

It

me

They
shook

then

Then
one

asked

a

Goliath

Some

the

consensus

unchanged
from

it

Well

the
FBI
can
drain
the
Pacific
Ocean
but
they
wo
n't
find
any
evidence
that

After
Dana
wrote
her
story
about

we
asked
in

Journal
NBC
poll
do
you
think
the

has
gone
too
far
in
handling
terror
suspects
overseas
,
or
is
it
taking
the
right
approach
?

Still

he

the
transaction
faltered
in

when

forced
to
increase
its
offer
to
US$
1.5
billion
following
a
counterbid
from
Rupert
Murdoch
;
the
deal
fell
apart
altogether
earlier
this
month

Still
,
without
many
actual
deals
to
show
off
,
Kidder
is
left
to
stress
that
it
finally
has
``
a
team
''
in
place
,
and
that
everyone
works
harder
.

Immediately
his
feet
and
legs
became
strong
.

And
that
could
work
in
this
case
Dan
because
we
do
n't
have
a

beast
looked
as
if
it
had
been
wounded

killed
,
but
the
death
wound
was
healed

That
really
hurt
.

Thus
,
it
would
be
more
effective
to
build
an
offensive
missile
system
to
deter
the
enemy
.

at
least
four

To
remove
the
threat
that
the
ice
icicle
caused
to
the
local
herders
,
the
local
government
has
invested
over
five
million
yuan
in
building
129

The
Father
gives
me
my
people
.

The
message
about

was
told
to
the
nations
;
people
in

world
believed
in
him
;
he
was
taken
up
to
heaven
in
glory
.

They
will
say
to
the
hills
,
'
Cover
us
!
'

and
so
it
's
in

It
is
believed
that
forces
advocating
and
maintaining
a
peaceful
transition
will
be
increased
greatly
,
and
destroying
a
peaceful
transition
will
lose
even
more
of
the
people
's
support
.

But
the
man
of
God
said
to
Gehazi
,
``
Leave
her
alone
!

He
stayed
there
all

praying
to
God
.

Thus
,
a
woman
who
used
RU
-
486
to
have
an
abortion
would
have
to
make
three
trips
to
the
clinic
past
those
picket
lines
;
an
initial
visit
for
medical
screening
anemics
and
those
with
previous
pregnancy
problems
are
eliminated
and
to
take
the
pill
,
a
second
trip
48
hours
later
for
the
prostaglandin
,
administered
either
via
injection
or
vaginal
suppository
,
and
a
third
trip
a
week
later
to
make
sure
she
has
completely
aborted
.

God
will
really
not
forsake
those
who
support
His
religion
.

The
Spirit
knows
all
things
.

Then
he
left
and
went
to
another
place
.

If
you
find

you

very
likely
to
find
signs
of

He
chose
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
shame
the
strong

And
if
it
's
not
,
it
's
like
,
you

you
're
going
to
have
to
deal
with

She
went
to
speak

ask
him

No
uh
the
only
thing
I
can
tell
you
is
that
it
would
appear
to
me
that
at
no
time
whatsoever
was

a

This
is
what
I
learned
:
The
Jews
said
this
man
did
some
things
that
were
wrong
.

But
Mr.

,
the

Thailand
's
Prime

Samak
stated
on
April
30
that
the
five
rice
-
exporting
countries
,
Cambodia
,
Laos
,
Myanmar
,
Thailand
,
and
Vietnam
,
can
establish
an
Organization
of
Rice
Exporting
Countries
,
similar
to
the
Organization
of
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
,
to
impact
international
rice
prices
by
bringing
"
combined
strengths
"
into
play
.

I
think
people
are
paying
heed
because
I
think
people
realize
that
there
is
a
sense
that
it
could
happen
.

The

his

50

It
's
an
activity
she
feels
she
can
do
for
life
,
and
by
pulling
a

she
still
gets
a
good
workout

There
are
people
that
support
the

An
opposition
spokesman
demanded
that
Milosevic
accept
the
electoral
will
of
the
people
,
that
the
Federal
Electoral
Commission
reveal
what
she
called
the
true
result
of
the
election
.

The
market
turned
quiet
after
rising
sharply
late
last
week
,
according
to
one
analyst
.

and
I
thought
oh
my
god
what
have
we
wrought
here

He

I
wonder
how
the

interpret
news
from
the
Washington

today
that
Del.

Wang

that
making

the

Aaron
mentioned
that
as
he
got
near
the
destination
the
night
before
his
trek
,
that
he
realized
he
had
n't
left
word
and
he
actually
thought
about
making
that
call
and
thought
it
was
too
late
.

People
all
like
to
call
themselves
son
of
the
people
,
and
son
of
the
Chinese
nation

He

but
she
did
have
a
heart
attack

Then
they
began
jumping
around
on
the
altar
they
had
built
.

God
--
the
one
who
made
all
things
and
for
whose
glory
all
things
exist
--
wanted
many
people
to
be
his
children
and
share
his
glory
.

In
that
case
the
benefits

disbenefits

But
,
it
is
this
"
Dragon
Queen
"
who
has
built
a
fortune
starting
as
a
wage
earner
,
who
shrewdly
and
effectively
put
forward
these
three
proposals
:
"

"
reducing
the

He
suffered
a

back

predict

trying

put
on

In

go

I
doubt
that

When
I
hear
about

I
think

certain
divas
who

Yes

At

there

fuck
the

do
it

Then
they
stopped
coming
,
and
we
heard
about
the
ads
,
and
they
were
exactly
what
we
had
presented
for
over
a
year
.

So
if
I
do
what
I
do
n't
want
to
do
,
then
I
am
not
really
the
one
doing
it
.

Of
course
President
Lee
Teng
-
hui
's
exercise
of
such
powers
has
not
proved
politically
destabilizing
because
he
has

Say
what
?

On
this
point
,
their
two
fates
are
connected
.

We
will
first
talk
about
the
Daily
Mirror
article
that
started
it
.

We
do
n't
have
anything
to
demonstrate
that
commercialality
.

As
a
result
,
they
often
speak
one
language
at
home
,
another
at
school
.

Is
n't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
asset
you
own
would
be
worth
more
if
the
government
suddenly
announced
that
if
you
sold
it
,
you
would
be
able
to
keep
30
%
more
of
its
gain
than
you
previously
believed
?

But
the

Adam
is

It
now
offers
30
regional

it
very
recently
began
running
ads
adjacent

and
it
has
been
beefing
up
its
sales
force
.

Today
,
the
Technology
Committee
of
Russian
Space

flight
Control
Center
held
a
meeting
to
analyze
the
reasons
for

failed
dockings

decided
to
perform
a
third
docking
attempt
on
September

Herodias
told
her
daughter
what
to
ask
for
.

Why
did
Russian
President
Putin
visit
Japan
again
after
,
an
interval
of
five
years
,
after
quite
a
few
twists
and
turns
?

Most
other
states
have
enacted
similar
bans
.

If
you
are
too
hard
to
please
,
they
might
want
to
stop
trying
.

As
we
continue
to
watch
Air
Force
One
,
now
on
the
ground
outside
Belfast
,
Northern
Ireland
,
we
'll
be
watching
President
Bush
emerge
from
the
plane
momentarily
.

Be
sure
you
are
not
led
away
by
the
teaching
of
those
who
have
nothing
worth
saying
and
only
plan
to
deceive
you
.

It
indicates
the
feature
of
"
heaviness
"
of
our
economy
.

Japan
's
plans
to
"
conquer
China
in
one
attack
"
and
to
"
take
China
in
three
to
six
months
"
were
not
mere
fantasy
.

Do
you
think
there
's
a
value
in
itself
in
having
someone
to
go
up
there
and
just
waste
the
place
I
mean
in
other
words
just
give
tough
speeches
try
to
humiliate
them
uh
try
to
get
them
out
and
get
them
straightened
out
by
just
making
fun
of
them
by
basically
trashing
some
of
those
Third
World
members
that
have
contributed
to
this
uh
horror
in
some
of
these
cases
you
mentioned
?

The
angel
's
glory
made
the
earth
bright
.

He
is
seen
as
leading
a
second
wave
of
"
anti-Lee
Teng

hui
"
sentiment
,
similar
to
that
which
led
to
the
creation
of
the
New
Party
several
years
ago
.

The
President
of
Yemen
says
the
boat
used
in
the
attack
on
the
``

was
bought
in
Saudi

.

One
dealer
said
the
talk
was
that
the
firm
sold
about
$
500
million
of
bellwether
30

bonds

Ah
,
it
's
a
very
large
problem
figure
.

We
have
to
be
respectful
of
Afghan
sovereignty
and
Tim
respectful
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
country
that
is
coming
out
of
twenty
-
five
years
of
civil
war
a
country
that
's
going
to
have
to
find
its
own
way
and
a
country
that
is
going
through
one
of
the
most
difficult
uh
debates
that
any
society
goes
through
.

Of
Iraq
's
27
million
prewar
population
,
about

some
3.4

left
their
homes
since
the
invasion
,
according
to
the
United

High
Commission
for

Also
,
many
of
those
peasants
who
came
into
the
store
to
buy
fertilizer
,
they
'd
come
into
the
store
,
and
they
really
did
n't
have
a
clue
,
and
they
'd
think
,
So
-
and
-
so
is
buying
that
,
so
I
'll
buy
that
,
and
they
basically
did
n't
know
,
they
did
n't
go
and
choose
something
based
on
what
their
own
land
needed

What
is
therefore
needed
is
a

this
is
what

what

Michael
,
as
I
read
the
article
,
we
knew
that
these
were
not
good
guys
,
putting
it
mildly
,
but
as
you
saw
and
heard
the
revelations
,
what
were
your
reactions
?

CNN
has
learned
that
the
crew
of
the
``
USS
Cole
''
was
not
briefed
on
the
seriousness
of
the
threat
in
Yemen
,
nor
warned
to
be
on
guard
for
possible
terrorist
attack
the
day
the
warship
was
bombed
.

And
it
's
growing
fast
,
with
annual
sales
gains
of
more
than
10

Some
underwriters
have
been
pressing
for
years
to
tap
the
low

Maybe
the
Lord
will
use
us
to
defeat

And
then

Sometimes
,
when

he
would
come
across

just

After

Reasonable

They

steps

They

If

Yet
much

They
commonly
give
two
scenarios

One

based
on

%
and
the
other
on
the
rate

is
currently
getting
on
investment
,
often
8.5
%
or
more
.

break
that
league
and
survive
in
it
as
long
as
I
could
,
and
being
in
that
position
today
is
something
big

me
