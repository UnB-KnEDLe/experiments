You

what

The

is
going

be

Well
,
actually
,
regarding
,
um
,
Koizumi
's
attendance
at
this
APEC
summit
,
people
are
more
interested
in
the
relations
between
Japan
and
its
Asian
neighboring
countries
,
including
the
kind
of
alliance
relationship
between
the
US
and
Japan
,
and
so
on
.

Last
year
,
Dentsu
's
foreign
business
accounted
for
less
than
10
%
of
total
billings
,
but
the
company
is
aiming
at
20
%
in
the
near
future
.

The
leaks
to
The
New
York
Times
and
the
publishing
of
those
leaks
is
very
damaging
.

In
late
New
York
trading
yesterday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8340
marks
,
up
from
1.8300
marks
late
Friday
,
and
at
141.90
yen
,
up
from
141.65

The
story
describes
an
unexpected
conflict
that
arises
out
of
a
misunderstanding
between
a
child
and
a

who
care
deeply
for
one
another

But
even
a

surprised
to
find
such

The

increased
from

We
also
saw
the
American

Willie
Montgomery
who
arrived
in
Belgrade
today
to
set
up
most
probably
a

Er

,
that
he
was
probably
,,

,
200

correct
in

Buried

Needless
to
say
,
he
was
talking
about
RICO
.

At
the
same
time
,
he
hoped
that
Taiwan
authorities
would
follow
the
trends
of
historical
development
and
take
opportunities
to
make
active
responses
and
wise
choices
for
the
political

between
both

of

.

In

there
could
be
some
federal

that
have
been
violated
here
.

Their
clothes
were
torn
to
show
they
were
upset
.

It
was
the
smallest
monthly
increase
in
a
year
.

I
'd
like
to
finish
out
until
my
actual
retirement
,
when
I
was
really
ready
to
quit
,
but
,
yeah
,
I
have
some
doubts
.

The
sale
to
the
Chinese
government
of
330,000
metric
tons
of
wheat
under
the
government
's
export
enhancement
program
was
announced
after
the
close
of
trading
Monday
,
but
the
sale
was
expected
and
failed
to
buoy
prices
yesterday
,
said
Dale
Gustafson
,
a
futures
analyst
with
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

Toymaker

refined

and
widening
her

,
as
well
as
giving
her
a
new
nose
.

This
,
he
warned
,
would
prevent
these
countries
from
bridging
the
difference
with
their
richer

.

So
the
man
left
and
told
the
people
in
the
Ten
Towns
about
the
great
things
Jesus
did
for
him
.

How
do
you
scald
them
?

That
was
tough
.

So
,
really
,
seriously
,
what
are
your
options
?

Then
Jesus
told
the
people
another
story
:
``
God
's
kingdom
is
like
a
mustard
seed
that
a
man
plants
in
his

Such

Here
's
the

problem
.

Yongchun
Wang
,
director
of
the
Yangpu
Economic
Development
Zone
Management
Bureau
,
said
that
business
invitation
work
in
the

and
the

When
he

,
David
spoke
to

It
's
a
bit
over
the
top
.
"

You
would
probably
assume
that
this
is
an
ad
for
a

's
beauty
product
,
would
n't
you
?

Well
,
he
says
he
has
it
because
he
uses
it
for
batting
practice
to
put
on
a
show
for
the
fans
.

So
what
's
happening
with
you
and
Sharon
?

We
stayed
there
for
a
few
days
.

I
mean
we
had
a
nice
little
visit
.

Foot
-
long
red
coffins
would
sit
on
counters
in
big

,
and

would
carry
around

In
recent
years
,
the
World

Most
were
obtained
with
huge
inputs
of
church
money
from
South
Korea
and
Japan
,
minimum
cash
downpayments
and
sizable
mortgages
.

Despite
my
being
convinced
that
it
should
be
limited
after
the
latter
's
aggression
,
it
does
not
in
any
way
reach
the
level
of
the
relationship
of
Qatar
with
the
Americans
themselves
.

Akayev
said
that
strengthening
co-operative
relations
with
China
in
such
areas
as
politics
,
economy
,
science
and
technology
,
culture
,
etc.
,
is
in
line
with
the
greatest
interest
of
the
Kyrgyzstan
people
,
and
is
also
one
of
the
first
directions
of
Kyrgyzstan
's
foreign
policies
to
be
developed
.

``

said
.

Johnny
Itaru
Kishigawa
,
director
of

Palau

,
says
that
the
government
is
going
forward
on
a
new
airport
and
a
number
of
tourist

related
facilities
.

But
there
are
so
many
changes
which
are
not
chosen
and
are
impossible
to
prevent
,
and
of
these
unemployment
is
one
of
the
most
fearsome
.

So
then
at

when

were

that

they
were
telling

all

seem
to
have
been

in

for

it
also
generated
a

ill

because
neither

anyone

willing

Soviet

opened
a
major
U.S.

exhibition
in
Moscow

the

loosen

The
system
's
inventor
,
Hsu
Yun
-
peng
,
only
had
a
junior
high
school
education
,
but
had
researched
color
matching
for
18
years
in
a
dyeing
factory
.

Unlike
the
Corey
Feldman
of
the
'
80s
,
today
's
tweens
are
n't
content
with
succeeding
in
just
one
of
medium
.

Officials
say
they
are
being
sent
to
strengthen
security
at
ports
used
by
Navy
ships
.

Now
they
saw
this
same
man
walking
and
praising
God
.

Anger
does
not
help
you
live
the
way
God
wants
.

he
kind
of
laughed

So
%uh
it
's
like
I
'm
in
the
same
boat
too
.

Then
two
men
told
the
people
that
they
heard
Naboth
speak
against
God
and
the
king
.

Often
the
case
is
,
"
I
give
her
a
good
slap
in
the
face
.
"

She
manages
it
with
the
title
of
general
-
director
.

They
dance
and
sing
this
song
about
him
:
``
Saul
has
killed
thousands
of
enemies
,
but
David
has
killed
tens
of
thousands
.
''

In
other
words
,
the
man
is
looking
for
more
peace
than
war
.

Because
Russia
was
in
a
deep
degree
of
overall
crisis
.

In
line
with
the
old
saying
"
the
newborn
calf
does
n't
know
that
it
should
fear
the
tiger
,
"
the
new
government
has
been
especially
active
on
the
diplomatic
front
.

I
tell
you
,
you

approved
general
counsel
Saul
S.
Cohen

to
settle
its
legal
problems
with
the
states
.

Nobody
cared
about
her
anymore
.

The
Soviet
president
and
his
prime
minister
,
Nikolai
Ryzhkov
,
spent
the
longest

about

The

,
the

subject

the

dictates

expressed
in

's
clear
up
an
extremely

that

Another

In

,
under
the
joint

of
both
sides

many
issues
of
mutual
concern
to
both

had
been
resolved
,
various
degrees

have
been

in
the
three

According
to
some
analysts
familiar
with

the

The
only
frenzy
I
saw
was
commercial
:
Booths
selling
World
Series
commemorative
stamps
and
dated
postmarks
were
besieged
by
fledgling
speculators
who
saw
future
profit
in
the
items
.

They
must
have
self

control
and
be
women
who
can
be
trusted
in
everything

It
's
a
fact

As
for
that

it

Now
if
Inter
Milan
formed
a
second

of
a

it
would
be
also
very
strong
indeed
.

But
then
again
,
even
with
a
blog
as
simple
as
mine
here
,
while
I
am
using
it
I
can
still
think
of
so
many
areas
that
need
improvement
.

The
complications
of
Diabetes
II
,
such
as
coronary
heart
disease
,
cerebrovascular
disease
,
nephropathy
,
blindness
and
lower
extremities
necrosis
,
etc.
,
have
become
the
mankind
's
third
biggest
killer
next
to
cancer
and
AIDS

plenty
more

So
David
went
and
brought
God
's
Holy
Box
from
Obed
Edom
's
house
.

Moreover
,
in
the
area
of
furthering
earthquake
precautions
,
the
entire
globe
has
not
seen
much
improvement
.

I
can
go
down
to
the
place
here
and

If
I
had
not
come
and
spoken
to
the
people
of
the
world
,
they
would
not
be
guilty
of
sin
.

If
I
did
any
of
these
things
,
I
will
make
it
right
.

And
I
really
missed

bore
messages

In

In
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
in
New
York
yesterday
,
retired
Justice
Lewis
Powell
contested
the
notion
that
the
last
Supreme
Court
term
marked
a
turn
toward
conservatism
:
``
Commentators
who
agreed
on
little
else
unanimously
proclaimed
a
`
shift
in
direction
'
on
the
court
....

You
want
proof
that
Christ
is
speaking
through
me
.

Immediately
,
while
he
was
still
speaking
,
a
rooster
crowed
.

``
We
're
making
adjustments
on

,
yes

nothing
radical

Craig
Nelson
,

story
consultant
on
``
Teddy

''

It
would
encourage
more
investment
in
American

.

This
varies
according
to
the
person
and
the
type
of
training
.

people
are
like
you
know

I
think
it
's
going
to
be
hard
enough
,

Unfortunately
,
for
some
,
strategic
stalemate
is
just
as
good
as
any
other
means
of
conservation
,
never
mind
whatever
other
harm
it
does
.

The
same
applies
to
other
types
of
high
-
tech
material
.

As
for
Japan
,
to
the
US
,
it
furthermore
has
lost
some
assets
,
diplomatic
assets
when
making
negotiations
with
the
US

Miller
becomes
the
second
journalist
in

two

covering

conflict
,
with
Palestinian
cameramen
,
shot
and
killed
by
an
Israeli
soldier
on
the
West
Bank
in
mid-April

Do
not
misunderstand
me
;
I
support
democracy
.

The
shooting
may
have
stopped
half
a
century
ago
in
the
Chinese
Civil
War
,
but
the
war
has
been
extended
by
other
means
-
diplomacy
.

That
is
not
true
.

I
will
repay
everyone
for
what
they
have
done
.

But
these
players
were
dead
.

That
is
to
say
,
this
involves
the
origin
of
the
Northern
Territories
issue
.

Really
?

In
a
report
out
last

,
John

Institute
say
that

taken
from

cancer
tissue
they
tested
are
missing

I
discovered
that

World
League
for
Freedom

complete
organizational
structure
,
is
a

the
UN

Department
of

Information

and
attends
the
Annual
DPI
/
NGO
Conference
every

Her
princess
character
is
not
well
developed
,
and
then
she
suddenly
becomes
a
widow
and
then
a
spy
and
assassin
.

so
he
like
had
you
know
,
one
hair
per
square
inch
on
his
head
.
yeah.
And
,
%uh
,
could
barely
talk
because
that
's
where
they
were
focusing
the
radiation
.

So
why
do
some
of
you
say
that
people
will
not
be
raised
from
death
?

The
oath
proves
that
what
they
say
is
true
,
and
there
is
no
more
arguing
about
it
.

Finally
,
I
think
it
important
to
point
out
the
extraordinarily
high
visibility
of
non-violent
civil
disobedience
in

days

intensive
media
coverage

Tencel

the
shrimp

which
when

Is
Al

Waleed
's
view
with
his
team
of
analysts

consultants
that
these
sinking

form
a

to
the

Some
analysts

wary

It

Coupled
with
the

a
large
number
of
good
team
members
have
retired
,
and
newcomers
just
took
over
,
therefore
the
overall
standard
of
this
competition
was
not
high
and
no
excellent
results
appeared
.

None
of
the

and
much
of

get
away

I

and
also
because
it
is
nice
like
if
you
are
going

Because

Soviet

There

no

've
set
the

You
have
to
turn
the

this
way

little
bit

shoot
back

Lin

says
that
it

Although
the
recent
spill
in
Taiwan
was
small
in
comparison
with
10,000

the

here
is
worrisome
because

Complying

When

that

fell

The

It

It

This
,

the

been
very
specific

Bush

that

It
's
the
wrong
site
.

Immediately
,
the
spirit
came
out.

China
's

industry
is
accelerating
the
pace
of
opening
up

striding
into

My
questions
on
this

at

,

scattered
the

First
,
why
ticket
splitting
has
increased
and
taken
the
peculiar
pattern
that
it
has
over
the

half
century
:
Prior
to
the

of
Franklin
Roosevelt
as

and
the
advent

smaller
role
in
society
and
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
problem
confronting
voters
in

for
Congress
was
considerably
less
severe
.

But
it
was
the
underlying
situation
that
became
intolerable

he
said
that

holding
meetings
that
involve
her
on
that
day
of
the
week
.

On
the
other
hand
,
they
make
sure
at
a
minimum
that
their
systems
are
described
in
their
employee
handbooks
and
talked
up
by

Saul
and
the
rest
of
his

Then

In
the
kind
of
literature
I
read
I
come
across
countervailing
opinions
quite
frequently
.

In
the
same
way
,
the
men
who
are
chosen
to
be
special
servants
must
have
the
respect
of
others
.

With
a
little
help
from
women
,
men
's
fashions
have
taken
off
:

Our
advice
is
this
:
Immediately
return
the
government
surpluses
to
the
economy
through
incentive
-
maximizing
tax
cuts
,
and
find
some
monetary
policy
target
that
balances
both
supply
and
demand
for
money
which
neither
aggregates
nor
interest
rates
can
do
.

For
some
at
the
SEC
,
an
agency
that
covets
its
independence
,
Mr.
Breeden
may
be
too
much
of
a
Washington
insider
.

For
instance
,
China
's
economy
is
growing
,
eh
,
and
getting
stronger
,
but
we
see
the
relations
between
China
and
South
Korea
are
indeed
developing
rapidly
.

The
pound
,
which
had
been
trading
at
about
$
1.6143
in
New
York
prior
to
Mr.
Lawson
's
announcement
,
sank
more
than
two
cents
to
$
1.5930
,
prompting
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank
to
buy
pounds
for
dollars
.

Ok
,
Bush
did
not
only
meet
with
the
Prime
Minister
,
but
he
also
met
with
Abd
al

Aziz
al
-
Hakim
,
one
of
the
senior
Shiite
leaders
in
Iraq
,
as
you
know
.

Then
the
sea
became
blood
like
a
dead
man
's
blood
.

And
anyone
who
is
circumcised
in
the
heart
by
the
Spirit
gets
praise
from
God
,
not
from
people
.

It
is
important
for
you
to
understand
what
will
happen
in
the
last
days

some

Murray

big
challenges

that

exactly
what

Our

must
continue
to
keep
close
watch
over
the
judiciary

voice
their
expectations

You
might
say
,
``

can

Unfortunately
,
it

turned
into

so
determined

to
meet

to
not

any
postponement

we

Because

do

government
employee

and
a
waiter
can
only

10,000

So
we
should
be
patient
with
those
who
are
not
so
strong

have
doubts

I
think

confident
that
it
would
be
safe
to
go
inside

having
said
that

once
inside
there
are

the

has
lost
something
special

What
it

is
propose
ways
of
dealing
with
a

who
is
not

who
is
not
benevolent

By

about

was
able
to
piece
together

This

what
leads
us
to
be
sure
that
everything
has
negative
aspects
just
as
it
has
positive
aspects
,
like

Again

all
this

an

inconclusive

Clearly

the

Besides

I

really
wondering
if
there

any

how

pay

convened
yesterday

What
I
and
,
hopefully
,
quite
a
few
other
Virginians
want
to
see
is
our
elected

walk
their
talk
.

So
that
means
that
they

Do

Or
is
it
an
actual
picture
in

country
of

and

?

It
gives
them
a
sense
of
what
they
have
felt
for
too
long
now
,
that
politics
is
just
name
-
callers
,
increased
partisanship
,
special
prosecutors
,
reliance
on
lawyers
and
things
that
do
n't
affect
the
ordinary
person
,
that
all
that
has
now
mushroomed
into
something
called
the
Presidency
of
the
United

and
how
we
elect
a
President

The
main
issues
remaining
are
how
to
calculate
damages
and
whether
the
infringement
was
``
willful
and
deliberate

In

ways
,
made

freedom
,
and
cited
the
popularity
of

in

Since
June
,
Rochester
Telephone
signed
letters
of
intent
to
purchase
three
other
Wisconsin
firms
.

They
added
that
the
DJIA
's
swift
drop
proved
an
easy
excuse
for
the
market
to
drive
the
U.S.
currency
in
the
direction
it
was
already
headed
.

To
help
him
,
the
U.S.
is
moving
quickly
to
lift
economic
sanctions
and
is
exploring
ways
to
send
aid
.

But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reasons
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process
of
case
-
by
-
case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading
.

It
's
necessary
to
explain
to
Iran
the
advantages
it
would
receive
if
it
agreed
to
start

,
but
that
there
is
one
condition
for
holding
the
meeting
--
the
activity
of
uranium

must
be
frozen

Mr.

But
this
woman
is
bothering
me
.

Joash
sent
all
these
expensive
things
to
King
Hazael
of
Aram
,
so
the
king
and
his
army
left
Jerusalem

In
West
Palm
Beach
Wednesday
,
an
independent
,
conservative
group
called
Judicial
Watch
asked
a
court
to
let
it
see
those
ballots
for
itself
.

Among
the
suggestions
:
Pantyhose
and
men
's
ties
could
be
used
for
slings
,
while
removable
wooden
shelves
might
aid
in
``
breaking
through
office
walls

''

You
could
also
buy
brass
toads
that
held
coins
in
their
mouths
.

Other
nations
are
n't
sure
how
many
weapons
they
have
in

The

Looking

I
bent
over
backwards

work

And
he
healed
all
the
people
's
diseases
and
sicknesses

Under
Mikhail
Gorbachev
's
perestroika
,
the
Soviets
have
sought
economic
ties
all
over
the
world
,
including
new
export
markets
.

This
degradation
of
the
flag
of
monotheism
is
a
continuation
of
the
act
done
by
some
silly
people
when
they
hung
it
in
the
house
of
prostitution
and
vice
!!

In
breach
of
regulations
,
somebody
had
turned
on
the
power
switch
without
evacuation
of
the
workers
,
resulting
in
a
tragedy
in
which
forty
-
seven
miners
lost
their
lives

He
credits

``
I

he

awarded
a

However
,
a

for
the

says
he
calls
the
court
ruling

not

Why
do
you
care
about
the

By

you
were

Furthermore
,
although
our
sense
of
security
increases
with
each
passing
day
in
line
with
"
significant
advances
achieved
"
in
seismology
,
we
can
not
look
to
anyone
to
give
us
any
promises
.
Because
,
once
someone
has
made
a
promise
,
he
would
be
doomed
thereafter
to
bear
this
bloody
weight
of
"
being
unable
to
effectively
avoid
earthquake
disasters

This
is
the
new
agreement
I
will
give
the
people
of
Israel
.

The
bottom
fifth
of
all
families
got
4.6
%
of
the
income
,
down
from
5.2
%
a
decade
earlier
.

The
minute
it
is
felt
by
the
instruments
,
if
it
is
possible
to
sound
an
alarm
on
the
streets
ten
seconds
ahead
of
time
,
giving
people
a
chance
to
get
under
desks
,
then
perhaps
that
would
save
a
lot
of
lives
.

Last
week
,
Revco
's
parent
company
,
Anac
Holding
Corp.
,
said
the
company
reported
a
loss
of
$
16.2
million
for
the
fiscal
first
quarter
,
compared
with
a
loss
of
$
27.9
million
in
the
year
-
earlier
quarter
.

Considering
how
tenuous
the
security
of
that
runway
is
anyway
,
the
better
option
--
both
morally
and
strategically
--
would
be
for
the
Bush
administration
to
blast
the
regime
publicly
,
in
terms
clear
enough
for
all
influential
Somalis
to
understand
.

A

With

the

He
scattered

great

Who
would
have
guessed
that
my

would
be
strongly
opposed

I
finally
decided
to
go
ahead
and
get
on
the
ball
.

``
I
can
do
nothing
alone

and
I
think
we
have
to
defer
significantly
to
their
judgment
in

And
the

came
and
licked
his

.

Since
all
of
this
is
incorrect
and
does
not
exist
,
it
indicates
the
falsehood
of
this
calumny
.

Well
apparently
,
because
he
offered

``

At

days
experienced
in
Somalia
,
as

of
both
the

It
is
setting
up

to
do

DeLay
also
said
he

get

At

we

We

of

we
are
close

we

we

we

So
why
do
n't

but
you
know
now
I
have
another
reason
for
talking
to
this
Guadalupe
you
know
--

God
did
not
choose
angels
to
be
the
rulers
over
the
new
world
that
was
coming

Do
this
so
that
your
people
will
fear

respect

all

time
that
they
live
in
this
land
that
you
gave
to
our

From

1927

,
with
the

Province

the
west
of
Fujian
Province
,
revolutionary
bases
in
Donggu

Qiaotou

Yongding

were
established
one

and
the

What

The

but
recent

with
Mr.

indicated
that
he
knew

no

Mr.

also
agreed
with
senators

concerns
about
recent
stock

market
volatility
,
and
said
he
realizes
that
the

scaring

Soaring

Souya
said
,
the

the

In
so
doing

he
has
done
much
to

40
years

Well
,
as
we
mentioned
earlier
at

,
a
very
important
purpose
for
Koizumi
to
go
to
attend
the
APEC

summit
in
Pusan
this

is
to
see
if
he

with

We

we

forecast
an

even
above
6.0
,
or
even
that
not
excluding
a
7.0
earthquake
,
that
we
can
say
.

then
we
climbed
everything
on

on

But
with

putting

the

no

Before
the
war
,
China
's
air
force
had
some
300
airplanes
;
that
may
seem
like
quite
a
few
,
but
they
were
all
used
up
in
just
one
year
,
and
afterward
we
could
only
watch
as
Japanese
aircrafts
ruled
the
skies
over
China
.

and
it
was
very
upsetting

The
latest
news
from
the
Ministry
of

says
that
,
up

Well
it

a

on

said
that

the

He

also

Then
we
can
say
we
have
reached
solutions
!!

a
feat

One
thing
,
however

remains
certain
-

The

``

Are
you
worried

You
look
at
the
many
policies
of
minority
consideration

but
you
should
also
look
at
how
,
in
a
majority

Han
society
,
in
a
society
that
stresses
uniformity
and
looks
down
on
individuality
,
there
are
just
as
many
mechanisms
and
opportunities
for
discrimination
against
minorities
,
if
not
more

But
this
puts
a
problem
before
the

among

migrant

from

That

literally
government

business
,
a
title
that
has
the
pejorative
connotation
of
doing

but
also
suggests
the
clout
inherent
in
maintaining
such
close
ties

Or
to
turn
this
completely
around
-
would
folks
support
the
right
of
any

to
zone
entirely

were

In
addition
,
local

say
the
new

is
important
in
helping
them
offset
their

They
are

We
recognize
and
I
hope
they
recognize
that
the
only
way
that
Congress
will
accomplish
anything
is
through
bipartisanship
.

U.S.
officials
are
denying
a
newspaper
report
that
claims
intelligence
agencies
have
obtained
hard
evidence
linking
Saudi
terrorist
Osama
Bin
Laden
to
the
bombing
.

Investors
have
a
lot
of
different
cards
they
can
play
,
so
they
've
got
to
know
why
your
business
plan
is
worth
pursuing
.

and
that
is
expressed
in
their
sexuality
.

Well
I
certainly
do
n't
want
to
uh
any
kind
of
excuse
the
officers
involved
.

Boeing
747
airplanes
can
land
at

Under

bill
,
the

secretary
would
have
30

20

to
review
any
proposed
purchase
of
15
%
or
more

Like
Mr.

's
arrangement
,
the
venture
gives
Mr.

a
link
to
the

largest
and
most
successful

distributor

in

about

And
frankly
I
did
n't
get
a
sense
of
urgency
at
that
point
because
I
had
no
idea
of
his
age
and
thought
he
was
just
a
student
at

school

For

Mr.

criticized
regularly
at

historic
moves
away

Everyone
is
the

the

be
succeptable

Peres
attained
this
as
a
result
of
..
knowledge
and
proficiency

in
his
personality
,
which
helped
give
him
an
edge
in
confronting
any

by
putting
him
in

and

It

So
you

A

In
New
Westminster
,
a
homicide
occurred
yesterday
in

It
was
therefore
not

that
close

neglected

So
,
my
brothers

,
when
you
come

wait
for

Companies
might
be
able
to
tell
salespeople
daily
,
for
instance
,
about
idle
equipment
,
so
they
could
offer

on

that

One
section
of
the

would
make
all

brokerage
firms

floor
brokers
liable

without
willful
misconduct

They
are
not

;
one
of

of

in

even

I

:
Is

Soviet

when

do
this

how
can
we
face

how
can
we

You
were
born
again
through

giving

that
lasts
forever

it
is
very
difficult
to
discern
whether

not
that
is
,
in
point
of
fact
,
the
missiles
that
we
have
become
accustomed
to
striking
Baghdad

whether
it
is
the
large
2,000
pound

bombs
that
have
been
striking
targets
selected
by
the

in
Baghdad
,
or
whether

represent
artillery
barrages

continues

take

Fifthly
:

do
so
a

is
vowing
to
remain
active
in

Such
efforts
--
unheard

only
a

--
are
the

For
years

we
tried
to
ignore
the
problem
of
poverty

now
that
it

gotten
out

it
's
a
new
crusade
for
the

and
our
Democratic

The

involved

opened

If
you
do
good

to
those
who

should
you
get
any

for
doing
that

as

the

says
it

In

to

as

The
swift
passage
of
the
bill
,
which
cleared
the
Senate
and
House
on
simple
voice
votes
last
week
,
contrasts
with
the
problems
still
facing
a
more
cumbersome
$
66.8
billion
measure
funding
housing
,
environmental
,
space
and
veterans

But
the
Soviets
also
are
insisting
that
they
will
reserve
the
right
to

The
current
condition
of
the

can
be
summed
up
in
three
key

workers
.

I
repeat
and
I
say
it
again
...
If
you
want
it

I
have
no
objection

Instead
,
they
are
working

transform

They
respected
the
Lord
but
also
served
their
own

just
as
they
did
in

But
they
would
not
answer

question

It

us
like
a
golden
opportunity
for

to
chop
off
at
the
knees
all
this
talk
about
a
timid
,
unserious
presidency
.

As
part
of
his
image
polishing
,
Mr.
Krenz
is
expected
to
take
modest
steps
toward
reform
to
rebuild
confidence
among
the
people
and
reassert
the

Below
I
'm
going
to
discuss
some
of
the
areas
that
you
need
to
pay
attention
to
when
setting
up
an
Internet
business
:

And
in
Boston
is
David
Gergen
White
house
advisor
to
Presidents
Nixon
Ford
Reagen
and
Clinton
professor
of
public
service
at
Harvard
's
JFK
school
and
editor
at
large
.

our
armed
forces
are
better
than
they
've
ever
been
.

Yes
,
I
know
that
nothing
good
lives
in
me
--
I
mean
nothing
good
lives
in
the
part
of
me
that
is
not
spiritual
.

One
is
the
Pao
,
a
tiny
coupe
with
a
peelback
canvas
top
and
tilted
headlights
that
give
it
a
droopy
-
eyed
look
.

I
mean
,
the
wind
blows
.

Second
,
Russia
should
be
seen
as
a
rather
strong
nation
.

The
defense
claims
that
police
search
was
illegal
and
therefore
the
diary
can
not
be
admitted
as
evidence
.

So
what
kind
of
people
should
you
be
?

Median
family
income

But
the
word
of
the
Lord
lasts
forever
.

I

Some

Stewart
is
associated
with
Kmart
since
1987

been
very
successful

One
reason
for
his
gloom
is
a
weekly
tally
he
keeps
of
stocks
within
a
point
of
hitting
new
highs
or
lows
.

What
?

and
then
it
was
challenged
because
it
said
well
the
only
reason
that
it
has
been
done
this
way
is
just
to
ensure
that
it
was

After
20
years
of
pushing
labor
proposals
to
overhaul
the
nation
's
health
-
care
system
,
Bert
Seidman
of
the
AFL
-
CIO
is
finding
interest
from
an
unlikely
quarter
:
big
business
.

Faced
with
questions
raised
by
some
legislators
that
the
government
is
focusing
on
the
little
three
links
as
a
tactic
to
postpone
the
full
three
links
,
Teng
declared
that
the
full
three
links
will
definitely
be
implemented
,
but
the
first
priority
is
to
coordinate
these
with
Taiwan
's
WTO
entry
,
with
secondary
attention
going
to
Taiwan
's
own
needs
.

If
you
looked
at
his
ad
he
aligned
himself
with
the
president
because
he
caught
on
rather
quick
uh
when
he
won
the
uh
primary
election
and
he
had
gone
on
a
radio
station
and
said
uh
that
the
worst
threat
to
the
United
States
was
not
Osama
bin
Laden
but
the
President
that
uh
people
did
n't
like
that
.

Hannah
hired
a
boat
to

there

You
did

them

Until
1980
,
when
Japan
joined
the
$
10,000
per
capita
GNP
club
of
the
advanced
countries
,
it
was
a
model
developing

But
their
value
as
investments
can
be
decimated
by
inflation
,
which
erodes
the
purchasing
power
of
bonds
'
fixed

dollar
interest
payments
.

Yet
sales
quantities
are
up
,
thereby
offsetting
the
falling
profit
margins
.

So
again
Pilate
told
them
that
he
would
let
him
go
.

now
it
's
time
for
your
rebuttal
.

Currently
,
the
Transportation
Department
does
n't
have
the
authority
to
block
a
takeover
in
advance
.

Wal-mart

out

thousand

that
Wal

-
seven

He
went
to
a

called

lived
there

Universities
,
however

say

Some
of
them

things

He
said
,
China
's
Customs
was
an
important
department
for

communications
,
and
should
be
aligned
with

class
advanced
Customs
systems
to
meet
the
needs

development

market
economy
.

Their
advanced
apparatus
and
equipment
,
highly
level
scientific
and
technical
staff
and
comprehensive
dominance
in
scientific
research
have
made
important
contributions
to
the
promotion
of
construction
of
national
key
projects
and
the
development
of
academic

Um
that
along
with
another

on
cable

usually
disappear
from

brief
reign

only
to
be
replaced
by
equally
short
-
lived
successors

Have
you
already
put
in
time
and
money
?

The
Lord
commanded
them
,
``
You
must
not
honor
other
gods
.

Things
have
not
gone
quite
as
the
U.S.
had
hoped
.

``
The
banks
we
think
would
fit
into
our
concept
are
either
government
-
owned
or
not
for
sale
,
though
Deutsche
Bank
would
be
able
to
pay
a
good
price
.
''

So
he
gave
an
order
to
kill
all
the
baby
boys
in
Bethlehem
and
the
whole
area
around
Bethlehem
.

They
were
103
or
206
.

In
response
to
this
sort
of
lie
,
China
politely
offered
a
denial
.

This
signifies
the
end
of
the
former
USSR
's
49
-
year
post-war
placement
of
troops
in
Germany
.

In
subtropical
Taiwan
,
with
its
many
native
snakes
,
there
were
once
snake
research
institutes
and
snake
shops
everywhere
,
and
people
made
use
of
all
kinds
of
snake
products
-
snake
meat
,
snake
blood
,
snake
penis
,
snake
skin
,
and
snake
venom
.

Yeh
also
made
the
sterilizers
,
and
both
lines
proved
to
be
very
profitable
.

And
Tina
Brown
,
editor
of
Conde
Nast
Publications
Inc.
's
Vanity
Fair
,
said
advertisers
are
frequently
asked
to
take
advertising
positions
in
the
back
of
her
magazine
to
relieve
ad
clutter
.

Mr.
Greenspan
said
the
inflation
rate
,
currently
about
4
1/2
%
,
``
could
be
brought
down
to
levels
which
are
close
to
zero
without
putting
the
economy
into
a
recession
,
but
I
do
suspect
that
there
might
be
some
modest
loss
of
economic
output
.
''

That
would
be
comforting
to
fixed
-
income
investors
,
many
of
whom
were
badly
burned
in
the
third
quarter
by
incorrectly
assuming
that
the
Fed
would
ease
.

It
will
never
sacrifice
the
environment
in
exchange
for
short
-
lived
economic
growth
.

but
that
did
influence
a
little
bit
.

Then
turn
this
man
over
to
Satan
.

Therefore
,
if
you
find
a
sentence
that
is
allegedly
said
by
God
,
but
effectively
turns
out
to
be
wrong
,
then
this
god
will
be
overthrown
.

When
you
first
heard
about
Sars
,
I
mean
,
did
you
suddenly
think
,
this
may
not
happen
?
this
could
stop
the
whole
thing
.

So
Jesus
has
now
poured
out
that
Spirit
.

The
average
should
drop
over
time
,
since
the
most
expensive
claims
are
being
settled
first
.

``
You
've
got
to

Switzerland

price
index
increased
0.3
%
in
September
from
August
,
and
was
up
3.9
%
from

year
ago
,
marking
the
first
time
this
year
that
the
index
has
fallen
below
4
%
on
a
year
-
to

year
basis
,
the
government
reported
.

They
planned
to
arrest
Jesus
and
kill
him
.

The
trial
thrust

How

Well

Even
the
minority
of
them
who
must
register
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
as
``
investment
advisers

people
who
are
in
the
business
of
counseling
others
on
the
buying

have
been
enough
to
swamp
the

In
Havana

800,000
Cubans
,
led
by
Fidel
Castro
,
marched
in
protest

Eli
asked
,
``
What

say

More
than
six

As
Tao
Hsiao

explains
,
band
music
only
appealed
to
a

and
it
was
very
expensive
to
keep
a

operating

The

Just
because
Stamford
,
Conn.
,
High
School
did
nothing
when
its
valuable
1930s
mural
was
thrown
in
the
trash
does
n't
mean
the
city
no
longer
owns
the
work
of

,
a
federal

ruled

and
also
I
'm
kind

about

Not

Some
were
astonished
by
the
number
of
people
who
are
staging
strikes
in
Lebanon
and
who
oppose
the
legitimate
government
of
al
-
Siniora
,
and
who
considered
this
as
mobilization
on
the
part
of
Hezbollah
and
its
supporters
and
a
confirmation
of
the
strength
of
this
organization
.

Untiringly
,
Yuan
Caishun
repeatedly
visited
him
at
home
to
persuade
him
.

He
said
to
them
,
``
If
you
come
to
me
but
will
not
leave
your
family
,
you
can
not
be
my
follower

It
is
also
an
international
power
.

In
January
1931
,
the
Central
Bureau
of
the
Central
Soviet
Area
was
established
.

Commercial
and
industrial
construction
rose
sharply
,
partly
because
of
three
large
projects
,
each
expected
to
cost
more
than
$
100
million
.

So
al

station
has
also
adopted
this
structure

And
their
suspicions
of
each
other
run
deep

The

The

produced
an

I

seen
that

the
deep
influence

leftism
at
that

many
good
things
about
the
totalitarian

Whether
the
impacts

China
by
the
US
economic
recession
can
be
resisted
and
the
impacts
on

can
be
alleviated

on
whether
or
not
China
can
truly
expand
its
domestic

Because

be
real

about
it

It
claimed
that
it
would
show
it

especially
the
representative

the

apparently

It
does
not
relieve
the
need
for
our
market
-
opening
efforts
for
both
goods
and
services
,
but
it
does
suggest
that
it
is
our
exports
of

,
and
not
just
borrowing
,
that
is
financing
our
imports
of
goods

went

$

for

which
are
usually

have

heard

No

With
over
40
voters
in

the

In
that
case
,
Mr.
Guber
and
Mr.
Peters
might
not
suffer
financially
,
but
they
would
be
left
without
their

considerably

what
it

Nearly
a

they
have
made
some

changes
to
anticipate
a

In

be
wise

It
was
the

You
can
tell
by
the
way
the
activists
on
both
sides
are
lining
up
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
Donnybrook
.

Everyone
who
saw
this
praised
God
for
what
happened
.

This
news
was
published
by
a
British
newspaper
months
before
it
was
published
in
a
Saudi
newspaper
:
A
Bengali
guard
at
a
mosque
raped
a
Saudi
child
in
addition
to
dozens
of
crimes
which
are
committed
by
Bengali
workers

Thirty
marks

up

go

They
got

six

After

God
again
listened
to
the
prayers
of

in
that

bring
it
here

a

court
to
halt
the
Commodity
Exchange
from
imposing
a

550,000
fine
on
his
firm
.

He
says
things
are
more
stable
now
and
that
the
transition
from
the
former
currency
known
as
the
sucre
has
not
been
difficult
.

All
this
went
on
largely
unreported
,
given
the
customary
media
diffidence
or
indolence
on
national
security
issues
.

They
all
wore
white
robes
and
had
palm
branches
in
their
hands
.

That
's
what
America
is
all
about
,
and
it
's
why
America
now
remembers
those
who
fought

won

Both
can
be
expected
to
go
after
the
market
aggressively
:
Gartner
Group
Inc.
,
a
research
firm
,
estimated
the
Digital
gets
30
%
of
its
revenue
from
the
manufacturing
market
,
and
Hewlett
-
Packard
gets
50
%
.

Look
outside
right
now
and
you
might
not
believe
it
,
but
snow
or
no
,
around
the
globe
the
year
2000
is
one
of
the
warmest
on
record
.

So
,
eh
,
this
,
the
EU
,
in
contrast
,
it
has
been
making
nonstop
progress
.

The
God
of
Israel
spoke
.

Half
of
the
people
followed
Tibni
the
son
of
Ginath
and
wanted
to
make
him
king
.

When
that
happened
,
he
became
friends
with
the
other
people
in
the
world
.

We
hope
the
countries
can
become
potential
friends
,
if
not
allies
,
in
the
region
.

That
sucks

totally
false
.

You
know
the
sad
thing
about
that
?

He
was
not
afraid
of
the
king
's
anger
.

The
Philistine
chariots
and
horse
soldiers
were
coming
closer
and
closer
to
Saul
.

He
defeated
all
the
Philistine
cities
--
from
the
smallest
town
to
the
largest
city
.

but
it
would
be
much
better
if
she
did
n't
have
to
drive
by
herself
.

President
Bush
would
do
himself
and
the
country
a
favor
by
rescinding
the
order
as
an
ambiguous
intrusion
on
his
ability
to
defend
America
's
national
security
.

That
country
recently
bought
200,000
tons
of
sugar
and
had
been
expected
to
seek
a
like
quantity
last
week
but
did
n't
.

However
,
up
till
now
,
er
,
the
Bush
administration
,
they
did
not
want
to
assume
responsibility
for
what
they
have
done
there
.

Lord
,
God
of
Israel
,
I
am
your
servant
.

It
will
not
be
like
the
agreement
that
I
gave
to
their
fathers
.

It
said
the
situation
is
caused
by
efforts
to
streamline
bloated
factory
payrolls
.

So
I
tell
you
this
:
I
send
to
you
prophets
and
teachers
who
are
wise
and
know
the
Scriptures
.

and
I
think
it
's
entirely
uh
probable
that
we
will
see
a
significant
draw
-
down
of
American
forces
over
the
uh
next
year
.

The
way
to
treat
this
is
:
control
the
amount
of
animal
and
vegetable
oils
we
consume
and
eat
more
vegetables
containing
chlorophyll
.

It
is
called
"
Ten
ways
to
build
a
flexible
personality
".

But
university
computer
specialists
,
who
welcomed
the
move
,
called
it
a
necessary
retreat
from
the
cutting
edge
of
technology
and
one
that
's
likely
to
increase
Next
's
sales
on
campuses
.

Rally

Inc.
,
a
Louisville

said
its
pretax
profit
rose
0.3
%
to
13.05
billion
yen
from
13.02
billion
yen
.

He
will
remain
chairman
.

If
that
proves
true
,
analysts
say
Banco
Exterior
could
be
a
prime
partner
--
or
even
a
takeover
target
--
for
either
a
Spanish
or
foreign
bank
seeking
to
increase
its
market
share
after
1992
,
when
the
European
Community
plans
to
dismantle
financial
barriers
.

Short
-
term
municipal
bonds
,
bond
funds
and
tax
-
deferred
annuities
are
some
of
the
choices
they
mention
--
and
not
just
as
a
way
to
get
a
higher
return
.

In
addition
to
servings
of
chicken
,
duck
,
fish
and
pork
,
they
always
have
some
of
the
specialties
of

including

Amidst

apparently
took

When

at

There
is
a

I
say
this
because
when
Jonah
preached
to
those
people
,
they
changed
their
hearts
and
lives
.

They
clashed
over
whether
to
build
a
domed

,
over
how
to
allocate
government
funds
,
over
which
romanization
system
should
be
employed

transcribe

But
the

,
besides
affecting
the

has
another
rarely

dimension

Since
the

Chen
Shui

,
and
James
Soong

running
roughly
equal
,
this
suggests
that
after

there
may
be
a
restructuring
of
Taiwan

political
party
system

And
if

the
long
-
dormant

penalty
laws
by

legal

required

so
that
's
why
people
ca
n't
have
colds
if
they
go
up
and
visit
the
gorillas
that
type
of
thing
.

Four
people
died
and
scores
were
injured
in
clashes
during
Saturday
's
run

election
in
the
Nile
Delta
province
of
Dekaharia
.

[daysafter]
I
guess
he
thought
that
by
dating
their
good
son
,
I
was
climbing
the
social
ladder
through
their
family
.

After
they
finished
making
fun
of
him
,
they
took
off
the
purple
robe
and
put
his
own
clothes
on
him
again
.

Those
who
accepted
participation
,
like
the
Al
-
Shaab
Party
,
Feda
,
Popular
Resistance
Front
,
some
of
the
independents
and
the
Islamic
Current
,
were
always
members
of
the
government
.

It
claims
the
Coast
Guard
failed
to
chart
the
rock
and
refuses
to
pay
damages
.

These
chemical
substances
are
often
harmful
to
the
human
body
.

Tamar
took
some
dough
,
pressed
it
together
with
her
hands
,
and
cooked
the
cakes
.

So
she
came
in
and
stood
before
the
king
.

Jesus
rose
from
death
early
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
.

So
far
,
instead
of
teaming
up
,
GE
Capital
staffers
and
Kidder
investment
bankers
have
bickered
.

Meanwhile
,
several
other
major
installations
around
the
Valley
--
America
's
center
of
high
-
tech
--
said
they
,
too
,
fared
as
well
as
could
be
expected
.

The
baby
's
aunt
did
n't
want
her
face
shown
on
TV
but
told
us
she
was
stunned
.

What
they
're
really
telling
us
is
that
the
race
appears
to
be
a
dead
heat
,
and
with
time
running
short
,
the
final
strategies
are
taking
a
sharper
form
.

But
even
Mr.
Boren
defends
congressional
oversight
.

and
then
he
'd
say
do
you
know
what
I
mean

It
is
very
difficult
for
one
person
's
ethnic
or
religious
status
to
shape
a
person
's
behavior
.

They
will
drink
the
wine
of
God
's
anger
.

For
40
years
in
the
desert
your
people
saw
what
I
did
.

She
lives
in
a
decrepit
basement
,
where
she
is
raped

You

may
God
take

blessings
from

Despite
the

,
some

are
guardedly
optimistic
that

road

.

In
the
field
of
anthropology
,
there
has
been
a
growing
trend
in
recent
years
to
rely
on
the
results
of
field
studies
to
check
the
veracity
of
historical
records
.

The
report
was
written
by
famous
experts
and
scholars
from
the
US
's
Harvard
University
and
the
University
of
California
after
nearly
six
months
of
research
.

I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
that
little
package
.

The
Lebanese
Constitution
states
that
immunity
should
be
removed
from
Parliament
members
if
they
are
pursued
for
penal
crimes
,
in
case
the
council
was
in
a
holding
round
.

But
steelmakers
must
also
find
new
markets
.

As
there
is
an
effort
to
``
anchor
the
dollar
''
either
to
gold
or
other
currencies
,
the
dispute
is
worth
examining
.

No
I
do
n't
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
big
hit
because
there
're
other
things
out
there
.

There
are
the
supply
-
side
globalists
,
who
seek
to
spread
the
advantages
of
a
common
currency
through
fixed
exchange
rates
.

As
Tsai
Chih
-
heng
,
Chi
-
chi
and
Shuang

tzu
all
agree
,
regardless
of
fame
,
they
themselves
are
still
free
spirits
in

``
I
thought

Each
company
's

of

would
be
based
on
their

of

Most

would
not

fair
that
it

the
existing

financial
responsibility
to
pay

for

A

Carl

,
scoffs
at
``

to
socialize
the

for

.

But
in
the
age
of
the
global
village
,
many
bosses
are
finding
that
relying
on

to
make
business
decisions
is
not
enough
,
and
that
they
need
systematic
management
concepts
.

all
had
earthquake

they

One
other
thing
Dan
worth
I
think
pointing
out
real
quickly
here
is
that
we
did
hear
for
the
first
time
today
a
potential
alibi
for
Littlejohn
.

God
told
Moses
how
to

I

and
my
first
paper

got
a
C
on

For
a
time
,
the
question
of
whether
to
hold
elections
for
the
National
Assembly
,
as
well
as
the
DPP
and
KMT
's
shared
policy
for
phasing
out
the
body
,
were
viewed
as
motivated
by
fear
of
the
growth
of
the
People
First
Party
PFP
.

Up
next
though
a
quick
check
of
what
's
in
the
news
right
now
including
some
late
breaking
developments
in
the
London
terror
investigation
.

One
such
friend
is
a
man
named
Takken
Chinese
name
:
Teng
Chien

tang
,
the
great
-
grandson
of
a
tribal
chieftain
.

I
am
saying
that
we
are
supporting
Joe
Lieberman
in
the
primary
.

Eager
engineers
espouse
direct

steelmaking
and
direct
casting
,
which
by
the
end
of
the
1990s
will
enable
production
without
coke
ovens
and
blast
furnaces
.

A
sudden
surge
or
drop
in

could
ruin

All
these
visitors
complimented
Chen

his

and
expressed
support
for
Taiwan

determination
to
follow
the
path
of
democracy
,
freedom
,
and
peace

The
damage
was
so
bad
at
Fossett
Corp.
,
an
options
trading
firm
here
,
that
it
was
forced
to
transfer
its
accounts
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
,
a
unit
of
Continental
Bank
Corp.
,
as
a
result
of
options
trading
losses
.

It
had
a
mouth
like
a
lion

How
to
go
about
undoing
the
environmental
destruction
that
has
already
occurred
?

But
two
weeks
ago
,
Sotheby

said
that
it
has
the
painting
under
lock

key
because
the

had
not
been
fully
repaid
.

Aeroflot
thus
pays
its
landing
fees
,
ground
-
handling
and
catering
bills
with
fuel
,
preserving
its
hard
currency
.

I
think
it
will
.

In
this
way
,
the
house
is
not
dumped
on
to
a
glutted
market
.

Terrible
things
will
happen
,
and
amazing

will
come
from

The

Broke
notes
that
the
sharp
rise
in
housing
prices
in
the
US
in
the
1960s
and
1970s
was
due
to
underlying
structural
factors

A

before

``

neither
really
applied
.

And
,
since
the
public
has
always
been
fascinated
by
gossip

voyeurism
,
reporters

will
strain

justify

George

In

two

So
Jesus

The

to

among

I
think
when
Bush
made
it
clear
that
he
wants
a
strict
constructionist
court
led
by
Scalia
,
attacked
affirmative
action
,
attack
of
women
's
rights
,
point
this
strong
ideological
line
is
shown
in
these
vote
totals
tonight
so
far
.

Lobbying
groups
should
be
free
to
lobby
.

With
unprecedented
fervor
,
all
the
people
of
China
's
ethnic
groups
plunged
with
boundless
enthusiasm
into
the
high
tide
of
the
construction
of
socialism
!

All
we

In
recent
years
,
for
example
,
Grand
Metropolitan
PLC
of
Britain
acquired
Heublein
Inc.
,
while
another
British
company
,
Guinness
PLC
,
took
over
United
Distillers
Group
and
Schenley
Industries
Inc
.

He
did
not
know
the
seriousness
of
the
issue

Bill
Safire
does
the
press
have
an
obligation
-

They
will
wear
white
clothes
,
because
they
are

Only
by
so
doing
will
you
meet
with

The

was

twelve

Chen
Chung
-
yung
points
out
that
rents
in
Macau
are
about
25
%
less
than
rents
in
Hong
Kong
,
while
Macau
's
connections
with
the
European
Union
means
that
it
enjoys
tax
concessions
and
generous
trade
quotas
.

he
will
know
th-

it
was
supposedly
an
agreement
we
made
together
that
he
approved
of

Three
and
a
half
hours
ago
,
I
learned
my
bf
's
father
has
already
been
remarried
for
several
days
.

I
'm
very
grateful
for
your
patience
and
your
understanding
.

The
followers
went
and
did
what
Jesus
told
them
to
do
.

Alright
now
you
g--

I
'll
bet
they
give
you
a
special
discount
though

But
Mr.
Lane
said
that
while
the
SEC
regulates
who
files
,
the
law
tells
them
when
to
do
so
.

Then
a
priest
,
whom
I
have
summoned
,
arrives
;

Take
one
look
at
how
they
're
reacting
to
Harriet
Miers
.

He
was
hidden
by
dark
clouds
filled
with
water
.

I
was
like
yeah
I
'll
see
how
long
it
takes
me
to
get
this
stuff
done
.

If
there
is
one
false
piece
of
news
out
of
100
pieces
,
readers
will
suspect
the
other
99
pieces

"
If
you
buy
TSMC
at
150
hoping
it
will
go
up
to
220
within
a
couple
of
months
because
that
's
what
you
need
to
make
your
final
house
payment
,
then
it
only
goes
up
to
200

you
'll
feel
dissatisfied

I
will
ask

By

After
Stewart
was
charged

authorities
Wednesday
,
her
lawyers
issued
a
statement
in

they
said

,
Martha
Stewart
has
done
nothing
wrong

I
thought
this
might
be
interesting
okay.

Can
they
still
be
described
as
wolves
.

But
who
can
tell
he
is
the
product
of
which
famous
master
???

Once
you
had
not
received
mercy
,
but
now
God
has
given
you

I
hate
him

will
not

anything
good

The

are
certainly
the

The

lackluster

Mr.
Butz
said
the
divergence
in
the
two
measures
reflects
changes
in
family
size
and
structure
,
including
the
rising
number
of
female

a
sharp
increase
in

They
are
always
fighting
against
each
other
,
so
that
you
do
n't
do
what
you
really
want
to
do

They
also
insist
that
touching
is
a
basic
need
,
as
powerful
as
the
need
for
food
or
sleep
,
and
that
the

Although
the
masters
--
the
residents
of
the
White

--
monitored
our
budget
and
had
hopes
for

the
evidence
for
that
is
Rice

stopped
in

Republican
team
working
with
her
to
discuss
Bush

new
crumbling
strategy

they
called
"

a

Aided

We
have
an
update
now
on
a
dramatic
story
that
people
everywhere
around
the
world
are
talking
about
.

I
do
n't
understand
why
I
act
the
way
I
do

On
the
contrary
,
the
clay
they
used
was
often
of
higher
quality
than
clay
today

Only
14,505
wells
,
including
4,900
dry
holes
,
were
drilled
for
oil
and
natural
gas
in
the
U.S.
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
,
down
22.4
%
from
the
like
1988
period
.

Tonight
,
the
latest
casualty
figures
are
6
dead
,
11
missing
and
36
wounded
,
but
Navy
officials
predict
that
death
toll
will
surely
rise
in
what
is
the
worst
terrorist
attack
against
a
U.S.
Navy
ship
in
modern
history
.

Warner
executives
also
filed
new
sworn
affidavits
denying
claims
by
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
that
the

oral
agreement
that
enabled
the
producers
to
terminate
their
contract
with
Warner
should
the
opportunity
to
run
a
major

come
up.

Now

television
and
radio
evangelists
are
under
scrutiny

After
years
of
talking
about
selling

Japan
,
more

more
U.S.

are
seriously
pouring
in.

But
ever
since
the
Supreme
Court
's
Webster
vs.
Reproductive
Health
Services
decision
this
year
changed
the
political
landscape
of
the
abortion
issue
,
the
president
seemingly
has
tried
just
as
hard
to
avoid
saying
anything
more
unless
pressed
to
the
wall

This

a
positive
effect

A
Chinese
writer
who
was
once
forced
to
burn
his
writings
to
save
himself
from
Communist
zealots
has
won
the
Nobel
Prize
for
Literature
.

It
had
been
built
in
fits

starts
over
more
than
two

The
loss
of
40
jobs
by
a
depressed
county
in
rural
Missouri
is
hardly
of
national
importance
except
for
this
:
If
the
most
environmentally
safe
way
of
dealing
with
a
national
problem
can
not
be
built
in
Atchinson
County
,
what
hope
have
we
for
dealing
with
the
wastes

produces
?

The
company
has
no
immediate
plans

close

it

which

remember
as
having
been
$
300
to

400

So
,
this
will
have
surpassed
what
it

now
for

Last
week
,
if
you
may
recall
,
there
was
a
strike
on
Afraid
in
which
a
number
of
Israeli
soldiers
were
killed
,
that
executed
by
coordinated
group
of
Islamic

as

claiming

the

in

the
results
are
considered
truly
uh

extremely
satisfying

encouraging
,
especially
in
connection
with
the
NationalList
,
which
really
takes
the
pulse
of

Do

Since

you

Yes

are
smarter
in

are

and
then
we
had
like
half
an
hour
to
go
into

asked

Everywhere
else
in
the
country
,
Americans
were
stopped
momentarily
in
their
tracks
to
think
of
the
mess
that
may
lie
ahead

They
found
it
at
an
industrial
complex

To
God

to

The
former

of

F.A.
,
a
defunct

pleaded
guilty
to
conspiring
to

by
concealing
worthless

And
they
will
rule

Then
the
followers
came
to
Jesus
and
asked
,
``
Do
you
know
that
the
Pharisees
are
upset
about
what
you
said
?
''

This
process
was
mostly
to
the
credit

``
After
I
began

,
the
Holy

came
on

just
as
he
came
on

Then
David

Question

:
What
sort
of
problems
do
you
want
to
solve
?

The

said
that

never

You

and
now
you
are
slaves

what
is
right

Then
,
at
Window
4
,
I
told
the
story
again
to
the
consul
general
,
who
stood
behind
the
bulletproof
glass
wearing
a
telephone
headset
.

and
all
of
the
sudden
he
began
to
-

In
Chengdu
,
which
is
over
100
kms
away
from
the
epicenter
,
the
earthquake
should
not
have
an
intensity
of
over
7
,
or
8
at
the
most
.

In
autumn

were
Babe
Ruth

says
Mr.
Smalling
.

In
the

way
,
it
's

decides

change
.

I

know

The
proposal
has
set
off
a
lively
debate
within
an
industry
that
was
far
from
united
to
begin
with.

At

one
death
is
blamed
on
the
storm
by
a
woman
who
was
hit
by
a

limb
.

We
welcome
the
preliminary
results
achieved
by

role
.

Alice
Chang
,
CEO
of
CyberLink
Corporation
,
whose
firm
has
become
a
much
-
coveted
new
entry
in
the

and
has
drawn
international
attention

A
``
concerning
''
item
the
analyst
cited
was
the
10
%
jump
in
expenses
,
which
the
bank
attributes
to
costs
of
expanding
both
its
consumer
credit

card
operations

its

branch
business

A
similar
threat
led
to
the
closing
of

U.S.
embassy
in
Indonesia

Finally
,
Saul
listened
to
them
.

His
name
is
Burt
Glinn
,
and
now
most
Cubans
are
getting
their
first
look
at
his

During

Or
did
they
?

So
he
took
some
water

washed
his

in

all
.

There
are
many
similar
simulations
,
and
many
cities
such
as
Nagoya
and
Osaka
have
all
their
own
earthquake
disaster
simulations
and
have
made
contingency
plans
against
earthquakes
based
on
these
simulations
.

Maybe
it
is
also
the
duty
of
our
media
institutions
which
presented
this
case
to
the
public
opinion
by
following
the
verdict
issued
by
the
Court
of
Appeals
with
intensive
interviews
with
a
number
of
jurists
and
scholars
concerning
this
and

Mr.

added
that
the

Solomon
showed

Where
non-violent
civil

I

Herod

Vote

buying
in

has
also
robbed
the
people
of
their
right
to
elect
the

tainted
the

They
should
be

Why
are
there
so
many
who
want
his

spared

But
that
does
n't
mean
Mr.

Mr.

might
not
eventually
get
their

on
some
of

Jesus
answered
,
``
The
truth
is
,
if
you
have
faith
and
no
doubts
,
you
will
be
able
to
do
the

as
I
did
to
this
tree

I
call
upon
my
Sunni
brothers
to
leave
and
avoid
the
fire
of

strife

Shiites

Or
will
this

change
any
of
the

the

the

held
up
surprisingly
well

visible
from

That
's
why
people
pay
a
premium
to
live
in
a
central
location
--

The
soldiers
were
going
out
of
the
city
with
Jesus
.

This
interview
was
in
Germany
with
German
television

Our

not
peaceful

our
enemies
are
still
eyeing
us
covetously
.

Then
a

in
terror
in
Great

The

killer

strategy
must
combine
"
quickly
changing
the
rules

with
management
thinking
that
is
characterized
by
a

willingness

unconventionality

a

did

Jesus
went
with
them
to
Nazareth
and
obeyed
them
.

Do
n't
come
for
healing
on
the
Sabbath
day
.
''

It
was
prepared
like
a
bride
dressed
for
her
husband
.

Jesus
said
to
them
,
``
Go
!
''

He
said
to
Amnon
,
``
Every
day
you
look
thinner
and
thinner

Goldman

,
Merrill

all
increased
the
proportion

This
was
where
they
had
eaten
the
bread
after
the
Lord
gave
thanks
.

``
I
think
the
market
could
pop
up
to
the
$
1.22
to
$
1.25
level
without
too
much
difficulty

he
said
.

But
he
estimated
that
a
raider
would
have
been
able
to
amass
no
more
than
4
%
of
the
shares
in
recent
months
.

With
your
help
I
can
defeat
an
army
.

and
um
that
's
one
person
I
really
really
wanted
to
do
an
interview
with
.

Yet
Japan
requested
that
the
Soviet
Union
return
Iturup
and
Kunashiri
as

Egypt
's
Middle
East
news
agency
carried
a
foreign
ministry
statement
that
said
President
Hosni
Mubarak
decided
to
recall
the
ambassador
after
Israeli
helicopter
gunships
attacked
Palestinian
targets
in
the
Gaza
Strip
on
Monday
.

``
Now
stand
still
and
see
the
great
thing
the
Lord
will
do
before
your

I
pass
that
buck
on
to
nobody

and
on
May

Brenda

Slade

"
Every
year
I
make
a
big
palaver
about
wanting
to
plan
my
life
and
how
I
'm
going
to
give
up
teaching
and
concentrate
on
broadcasting
.
"

Then
Jesus
told
this
story
:
``
Look
at
all
the
trees
.

That
's
because
under
Israel
's
election
rules
,
only
a
sitting
member
of
parliament
can
run
in
a
special
election
.

What
can
I
do
to
take
away
Israel
's
sin
,
so
that
you
can
bless
the
Lord
's
people
?
''

You
had
two
?

The
Israeli
spokesman
said
there
were
two
simultaneous
attacks
at
an
intersection
.

Iraq
suffered
a
lot
from
this
situation
before
nationalization
.

Traders
who
had
sold
contracts
earlier
,
in
hopes
of
buying
them
back
at
lower
prices
,
yesterday
were
buying
contracts
back
at
higher
prices
to
limit
their
losses
.

That
eternal
glory
is
much
greater
than
our
troubles
.

%eh
here
's
why
I
call
them
that
.

Under
these
circumstances
,
Taiwanese
universities
,
which
actively
recruited
abroad
,
were
a
natural
choice
for
many
Macau
students
.

Finally
,
the
consul
said
,
``
We
hear
stories
like
this
all
the
time

Kemper

James

John
worked
together
with
Simon

So
it
's
a

He
took
his

But
Melchizedek
,
who
got
a
tenth
from
Abraham
,
continues
to
live
,
as
the
Scriptures
say
.

Assuming
that
the
couple
's
order
of
separation
is
traced
to
what
are
referred
to
as
"
behavioral
aspects
"
such
as
the
desertion
of
the
husband
and
a
long
-
term
conditional
divorce
,
what
should
the
wife
do
,
I
wonder
.

The

down
7.1
%

maybe
you
should
check
out
your
biorhythms

Will
the
major
investors
return
with
the
entry
of
Al

Waleed
as
it
is
generally
known
that
any
market
has
its
bottom
with
the
investors

its
peak
with
the
speculators

Million

and
then
I
've
started
doing
that

I

it
's
a
pain
in

ass

because
I
went

If
I

I
was

after

they
faced
the

Wall

skeptical

While

was
well
short

Somehow
I
doubt
she
would
have
gotten

with

if
it
involved
massive
central

regional

.

This
is
all
there
is
in
the
world
:
wanting
to
please
our
sinful

,
wanting
the
sinful

we
see
,
and
being
too
proud
of
what
we

The

The
Mubrid
Company
is
a
company
that
owns
the
biggest
land
transport
fleet
in
the
Middle

Mr.

According
to
Wang
Hao
,
personal
relationships
in

small

very
close

up

Mr.

of
what

Last
week
Williamson
,
a
mother
of
four
,
was
found
stabbed
to
death
at
a
condominium
in
Greenbelt
,
Maryland
.

All
the
people
of
Israel
wanted
me
to
be
their
king
.

It
is
,
in
fact
,
the
deadliest
conflict
since
World
War
II
and
has
been
going
on
for
five
years
.

David
went
into
God
's
house
.

and
then

The
men
in
the
camp
heard
that
Zimri
had
made
secret
plans
against
the
king
and
killed
him
.

The
scientists
have
experimented
on
the
tiny

Mr.
Murphy
of
Meredith
said
one
advertiser
,
which
he
would
n't
identify
,
wants
Meredith

Meredith

publish

So
this
starts
in
late
August

In
the
past
17
years
,
the
gross
domestic
output
value
of
Shenzhen
has
been
increasing
at
a
high
speed
of
an
yearly
average
of
more
than
30
%
,
having
reached
95
billion
yuan
in
1996
.

On
a
night
in
late
July
1940
,
the
atmosphere
in
Zhuanbi
Village
in
Shaanxi
was
unusual
.

I
mean
we
are
made
right
with
God
through
faith
,
not
through
what
we
have
done
to
follow
the
law
.

That
is
to
say
basically
all
future
rebuilding
will
be
done
through
the
Construction
Authority
.

Rates
are
determined
by
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
face
value
.

And
I
will
also
give
you
what
you
did
not
ask
for
.

But
they
all
shouted
,
``
Kill
him
!

So
,
he
is
considered
to
have
managed
your
home
effectively
.

I
mean
it
was
all
you
know
just
ridiculous
.

Mr.
Ondaatje
sold
his
stake
in
Pagurian
Corp.
to
Hees
earlier
this
year
and
is
said
to
be
seeking
a
media
acquisition
.

``
They
all
said
they
invested
huge
amounts
of
money
.

The
tank
rested
on
the
backs
of
12
bronze
bulls
.

It
lent
money
to
banks
and
encouraged
them
to
make
funds
available
to
brokerage
houses
.

On
the
judgment
day
,
you
people
who
live
now
will
be
compared
with
the
people
from
Nineveh
,
and
they
will
be
witnesses
who
show
how
guilty
you
are

Alternatively
,
a
separate
engine
plant
may
be
built
as

planned
tie

up

British

car
maker

sources

But
under
Jerry
Perry
's
direction
the
current
Steppenwolf
production
,
scheduled
to
play
through
Nov.
19
,
breaks
through
the
flat
and
boring
ritual
that
``
The
Homecoming
''
had
become
.

Jiahua
Zou
said
that
in
visiting
Canada
in
the
past
several
days

he
personally
experienced
strong

the
Canadian
government
and
people
from

But
most
of
the

Kohl

I

I
may
be
one
of
the
few
people
to
have
read

all

I
have
n't
talked
to
him

but
obviously
we
take
very
seriously
uh
any
suggestion
that
uh
this
may
have
been
done
at
the
beginning
of

fell
slightly
in

South

n't
it

But
there
are
still
some
people
who
turn
a
blind
eye
to
it
,
so
some
places
should
have
this
kind
of
business
ethics
.

Mr.
Boren
is
confusing
consensus
on
general
principles
with
agreement
on
specific
actions
.

So
,
it
's
not
all
that
hard
to
push
a
rope
-
you
just
need
to
freeze
it
first
.

Because
beauty
really
does
n't
lie
in
the
time
of
the
realization
of
a
desire
but
lives
profoundly
in
the
yearning
for
the
goal
.

Others
suggested
,
however
,
that
the
Fed
will
hold
any

policy
in
check

leaving

around
8

you

you

of

they
have

get
something
comparable

is

But
they

not

the

deep
into
their
lives

And
most
of
these
are
absolutely
unnecessary
.

Here
is
the
explanation
.

They

someone

this
marriage

Frankly
,
the
only
way

to

it

to
buy
drugs
at

cost

While

I
think
it
is
right
for

to
remind

Now
that

been

,
this
part
of
the

is
avoided
by
most
native

abandoned

the

there
any

once

this
is
not
thanks
to
the

is
the

you
already
know
:
Remember
that
the
Lord
saved
his
people
by
bringing
them
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
.

He
Nasrallah
can
raise
his
voice
with
curses
,
abuse
and
selected
insults
and
no

one
can
keep
up
with
him
.

Right.

And
yet
another
familiar
face
will
grace
``
the
West
Wing

the
incoming

We

sometimes

but
we
are
not
destroyed
.

I
mean
and
it
was
George
Tennet
was
it
not
who
said
it
's
a
slam
dunk
.

What
about
your
crew
that
was
actually
involved
in
the
rescue
here
?
are
they
trained
for
this
sort
of
thing
?

Dr.
Vogelstein
and
a
doctoral
student
,
Eric
Fearon
,
began
months
of
tedious
and
often
frustrating
probing
of
the
chromosomes
searching
for
signs
of
genetic
damage
.

It
has
always
been
so
.

What
was
even
more
disheartening
was
China

disintegration
:

Was
that

bad
as
it
got
with
these
guys
?

Gordon

the
forces
opposing
Goulart
as
"

"
and
it
was
they
who
had

convinced

the

to

Another
follower
there
was
Andrew

Peter

So
me
,
what
I
want
is
that
they
should
be
punished

Then
the
high

stood
up

The
message
from
the
Israeli

is
that
its

not

that

where
there
could
be

have
a

the

basically
neither
side
enters

a
great
sense

hope

but
I
think
both
sides
ultimately
recognize
that
in
a
way
if
they
are
to
have
some
kind
of
agreement
or
if
they
are
to
live
with
each
other
,
they
have
either
got
to
do
it
by
negotiation

by
blood

think
obviously
most
people
would
rather
live
with
each
other

peace

the
peace
which
can
be
found
through

So
now
those

respected

but
they
also
served

Then

I

the
lives
of
more
people
,
risking

One
of

that

As
the

fades

business
increases
for

so
that
the
condition

becomes
a
reflection
of
the
overall
employment
situation

what
do
the

None
of
the
above
was
problems
at
the
time
of

goes

cautious

let
me
give
you
an

be
dimmed
and
dulled
and
suddenly
I
would
n't
know
how
to
act
anymore

call
anyone

Introduction

How
really
nice
it
would
be
if
Putin
said
some
similar
words
after
investigating
the
assassination
of
journalist
Anna
Politkovskaya
behind
her
own
home
door
.

``
This
is
no
time
to
be
playing
in

and
that
Sunday
night
while
we
were
there
she
had
that
small
heart
attack
.

Mrs.
Wei
has
hinted
a
few
times
to
her
husband
that
she
should
just
stay

and
concentrate
on
looking
after
the
children
.

From
the
viewpoint
of
East
Asian
societies
,
the
West
tends
to
over-emphasize
freedom
and
individual
rights
,
and
this
leads
to
serious
problems
.

The
companies
running
the
disaster
ads
certainly
do
n't
see
themselves
as
ambulance
chasers
,
either

After
King
David
moved
into
his
new

the
Lord
gave
him
some
relief
from
all
of
his
enemies
around
him

This

Koizumi

Veteran
radio

Tao
Hsiao

recalls
that
when
she
wanted
to
organize
a
concert
in
the
1960s
,
there
were
already
a
lot
of
bands
to
choose
from
.

His
body
did
not
rot
in
the
grave

How
can
I
explain
this
?

Then
he

Whereas
the
advance
of
globalization
will
spur
sources
of
new
demand
from
China
,
India
and
other
commodity
-
intensive
economic
systems
,
asymmetry
between
supply
and
increasingly
fierce

exponents
of
supercycles

highest

forecasts
in
history
.

In
its
opinion
,
the
Saudi
criminal
justice
system
facilitates
detainees
being
exposed
to
harm
during
the
period
they
are
in
custody
and
under
investigation
,
the
reason
for
this
being
the
lack
of
judicial
supervision
.

The

But

He
was
like
a

But
it

lead
to
German

Mr.

In

I
think
that
Lawrence

tomorrow

is
going
to
ask
the
court
to
hold
the

,
moot
and
dismiss
it

That
's
been
a
base
for
international
journalists
in
Baghdad
.

Uh
Ethan
how
long
have
you
known
the
alleged
shooter
?

Huggins
,
39
years

was

It
was
weighing
everything
down.

Mr.

's
performance
was
decidedly
less
inspiring
.

The
report
,
released
yesterday
,
comes
as
Congress

of

breaks
only
three
years
after
the
sweeping
tax

revision
legislation
abolished

great
issues
critical

It

In
the
second
Apache

Having
said
that
,
we
must
caution
against
an
apparent
tendency
to
overstate
the
case
.

For
example
,
a
child
in

early
teens
might
babysit

Gutting

,
I

The
Big

's
disclosure
of

was
unusual
.

I
think
it

more
suitable
to
my
personality
and
to

God
did
this
so
that
every
person
will
bow
down
to
honor

But
when
asked
what
exactly
he
does
in
business
,
he
immediately
takes
offense
.

The

's
benchmark
30

year
bond
,
which
jumped
3/8
point
,
or
about
$
3.75
for
each

1,000

amount
,
during
the
first
hour
of
trading
,
ended
little
changed
.

And
every
place
he
went
,
the
people
brought
sick
people
to
the
marketplaces
.

``
It

''
he
says
.

As
we
've
discussed
elsewhere
on
this
blog
,
the
transfer
of
wealth
between
regions
is
accounted
for
primarily
by
the
``
Standards
of
Quality
''
funding
formula
that
redistributes
resources
from
affluent
school
systems
to
poor
school
systems
,
and
secondarily
by
road
-
funding
formulas
that
favor
rural
areas
.

Kurzweil

Inc.
said

she
came
forward

or
slow
down
,
the

subject
to
regular
and
destructive
flooding
.

This
requires
wisdom
.

The
move
,
which
injects
capital
into
the
system
,
is
seen
as
an
effort
to
reassure
the
finanicial
markets
that
the
U.S.
central
bank
is
ready
to
provide
the
ample
liquidity
.

But
I
tell
you
,
do
n't
fight
back
against
someone
who
wants
to
do
harm
to
you
.

A
story
has
to
have
drama
and

.

Since
the
company
has
got
to
crystallize
the
investors

and
staff
's
talents
and
energies
,
its
vision
for
the
future
has
to
be
attainable
.

So
that
was
one
of
the
things
kind
of
like
that

Yemeni
police
also
believe
they
have
found
three
other
locations
in
this
neighborhood
also
used
by
the
bombers
.

I
did
n't
know
that
you
did
n't
want
to
talk
about
that
at
all
.

Workers
could
dial
out
,
but
they
could
n't
receive
telephone
calls
.

But
"
greed
and
covetousness
"
have
made
him
envy
the
poor
their
daily
bread
and
he
stole
it
from
their
mouths
.

In
addition
,
President

has
written
to

you
heard
that

It

I
have
to
tell
you
that
when
I
married
my
first
husband
Bruce
I
went
into

year
.

It
involved
the
athletics
director
,
two
different
football
coaching
staffs
,
and
school
trustees
and
governors
--
just
about
everybody
,
it
seemed
,
but
Donald
Shields
,
the
university
's
president
.

And
because
of
the
authority
I
have
in
Christ
,
I
feel
free
to
command
you
to
do
it
.

United

move
that
stunned
the

it
hardly
ushers

anytime

whoever
is
willing

give
up

keep

Recent
economic
reports
indicate
the

is
slowing

leading
analysts
to

that

a
more
neutral
stance

Mr.

says
in

told
last

that

''
the
picture
,
and
another
producer
would
be
giving
all
of
the
orders
.

Tomorrow
night
Rod
Stewart

and
one
has
to
ask
what
was
the
alternative
?

Let
's
go
to
the
Jordan
River
and
cut
some
wood
.

My
wife
is
very
lazy
,
and
when
the
timer
sounded
,
she
turned
off
the
heat
and
left
the
pot
sitting
on
the
stove

I
thought
it
would
be
quiet

Or
you
have
n't
thought
about
%um
Ho
Chi

thing
or
what
did
they
used
to
play
Pat
and
those
guys
%uh

He
also
demanded
several
times
that
Bush
and
Blair
be
tried
for
their
crimes

the
hearings
do
matter

That
's
the
only
way
to
improve

The
promotion
of

of
cross-strait
relations
conforms
to
the
common
interests
and
expectations

people
have
no
excuse
for
the
evil
they
do

that

traditionally

doubts
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
several
years
earlier
a
Princeton
University
researcher
,
Arnold
Levine
,
had
found
in
experiments
with
mice
that
a
gene
called
p53
could
transform
normal
cells
into
cancerous
ones
.

He
says
he
would
save
Social
Security
by
reducing
the
national
debt
and
giving
Social

extra
money
.

The
PRC
's
extremely
assertive
deployment
of
armed
capability
opposite
Taiwan
is
deeply
felt
in
the
ROC
.

However
,
it
was
used
by
anti-Chinese
force
as
an
opportunity
to
attempt
to
shame
China
.

Nevertheless

The
implication
that
if
a

calls
about
a
project
in
his
district
there
's
something
wrong
,
I
think
is
most
unfortunate

In

One
basis
for
linking
change
in
the
East
and
change
in
the
West
is
the
notion
that
integrating
110

Eastern

with
320
million
Western
Europeans
is
primarily
the
task
of
Europeans
,
despite

And
you

The

succeeded

You
hardly

Support

the

In

the

on

let

what

By

Well
we
arrived
just
as
the
traffic
was
going
in
for
the
game

where
did
it
go
.

At

And
ballots
of

It

from

that

That
afternoon
we
basically
did

It

By

1,000

and
10,000

Afghan
troops
had
arrived
in
Kandahar

He
was
the
son
of
Beor

who
loved
being
paid
for
doing
wrong

The
performance
of
these
large
retailers

has
been
startling
,
and
superstore
chains
from
Holland
,
France
,
the
United

Britain
have
been
arriving
on
these
shores
one
after
another
.

But
after
a
dozen
years
out
of
office
,
and
against
the
entrenched
power
of
an
heir
apparent
,
he
would
soon
enough
discover
that
backing
just
was
not
there
.

With

Yesterday
Qingqing
gave
Mom
a
very
clever
retort
.

So
he
took
the
30
silver
coins
back
to
the
priests
and
the
older
leaders
.

It
was
pretty
funny

The
road
was
straight

Instead
of
flooding
the
entire
economy
with
liquidity
,
and
thereby
increasing
the
danger
of
inflation
,
the
Fed
could
support
the
stock
market
directly
by
buying
market
averages
in
the
futures
market
,
thus
stabilizing
the
market
as
a
whole
.

But
new
infrastructure
is
not
because
it
depends
on
the
RATE
of
growth

He
cited
the
example
of
San
Francisco
's
financial
district
,
where
many
new
glass
towers
survived
almost
unscathed
.

November
gasoline
slipped
slightly
.

Because
brand
loyalty
is
weak
and
most
cosmetics
purchases
are
unplanned
,
careful
training
of
store
sales
staffs
by
cosmetics
companies
is
important
.

How
old

The
number
of

that
became

went
from

than
200

So
,
in
this
way
,
it
has
borrowed
some
of
the
BBC
style
.

The
prime
minister
,
whose
hair
is
thinning
and
gray
and
whose
face
has
a
perpetual
pallor
,
nonetheless
continues
to
display
an
energy
,
a
precision
of
thought
and
a
willingness
to
say
publicly
what
most
other
Asian
leaders
dare
say
only
privately
.

Manville
and
the
trust
are
discussing
the

but
no
decision
has
been
made

How
long
are
you
going

But
in
a

it

good

Bechtel
Power
Corp.
last
year
announced
a
joint
venture
to
buy
the
plant
,
currently
owned
completely
by
the
utility
.

But
God
chose
him
.

Of
course
,
he
wanted
those
great
people
to
be
made
perfect
too
,
but
not
before
we
could
all
enjoy
that
blessing
together
.

I
could
n't
stop
him

Mr.

,
who
is
60
years
old
this

,
simply
could
n't
withstand
this
"
gentle
offensive
"
of
his

became
the
first
"
builder
of
illegal
buildings
to
pay
his
own
expenses
of
tearing
down
an
illegal
building
"
in
the
city
.

Then
I
saw
another
beast
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
.

These
people
go
back
for
generations
here

The
economic
ignorance
of
the
sound
bites
and
commentary
I
've
seen
on
national
television
knows
no
bounds
.

But
now
put
these
things
out
of
your
life
:
anger
,
losing
your
temper
,
doing
or
saying
things
to
hurt
others
,
and
saying
shameful
things
.

But
as
I

there
's
a
lot
going
on.

Each
country
has
temporary
desires
and
interests

better

There

Mr.

said
Hsu
,
since
the
government
has
not
necessarily
built
up
a
consensus
in
support
of
its

against

,
another
option
might
be
to
have
the
premier
resign
,
disband
the

,
and
elect
a
new

so
that
the

can
express

it

therefore
the

there

According

the

Michael
Blair
,
former
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Enfield
Corp.
,
failed
to
win
election
to
the

at

meeting
.

``
It
's
too
early
to

what

The
economic
malaise
which
has
spread
through
Taiwan
in
just
the
last
two

is
rapidly
overtaking
tens

And
the
Treasury
's
$
17.6
billion
auction
of
short

term
bills
,
which
generated
strong
buying
interest
,
helped
to
lift

out

In

Despite
such
anecdotal
evidence
,
however
,
there
are
hopes
that
there
will
be
positives
from
the

All
the

Shallum
did

I
quite

the

however

not
hopes

In
1974
,
as
the
U.S.
representative
to
the
United
Nations
,
he
wrote
an
introduction
to
a
book
on
world
population
in
which
he
boasted
of
his
leadership
during
his
term
in
Congress
in
expanding
family
-
planning
services
for
the
poor
.

But
this
did
not
bother
Gallio
.

Well
tha-

``
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
want
to
give
out
his
current

Absalom
said

According

,
``

So
show

I

If

it
is
like
a

having
a
funeral
on
the
one
hand
and
a
wedding
on
the
other
,
which
is
unacceptable
,
unreasonable
and
absurd
.

His
aims
were
specific
:
through
the
surreal
,
visualizing
the
impulses
of
the
uncon

scious
,
he
would
,
he
said
,
``
shatter
the

of

and
force
the

or
spectator
to

permanency

So
,
from

he

feel
it

even

All

It
virtually
dictated
how

Mr.

are
not

``
From

this

Both
President

have
held
a

and
with
each
one
they
have
increased
the
number
of
Stars
and
Stripes
they
use
as
a
backdrop
.

Then
it
is
God

will
be
praised
in

They

is
not

even
more
is
a
critical
moment

split
up
,

It

now
become
clear

that

there
have
to
be
reasonably
uniform
standards

for

But
I
felt
the
need
to
write
to
you
about
something
else
:
I
want
to
encourage
you
to
fight
hard
for
the
faith
that
God
gave
his

China
must
ensure
the
stable
economic
development
in
2007
in
order
to
harvest
the
fruit
of

development

However
,
with
the
rising
of

economy
as
a
whole
and
the
improvement
of
transportation

conditions

,
the
number
of

has
obviously
increased
in

I

feeling

oh
my

should
all
of
this
be
in
the
public

or
something
.

So
when
the
time
comes
for
these

to
happen
,
you
will
remember
that
I
warned
you

but
for
some

you
have
to
have
at

What
happened

then
the

Under

principles

national
interest

the
welfare

those

both
fulfill
their

by

realize
the

One
of
the
reasons
Bush
administration
aides

anxious

insist
that

informal

to
avoid
comparisons
with

last

1986

Mr.

There

In

capacity

conditions

them

their
indifference

what
is
happening
now
,
their
lack
of
consideration
for
the
complaints
of
people
and
their
reports
,
and
the
insistence
of
security
patrols
that
it
is
essential
to
go
to
the
police
departments

report
any

violations
,

At
the
time
when

rise
from

there
will

One
of

men
there
was

When

And
greetings
from
Jesus
,
the
one
who
is
also
called
Justus
.

He
says
that
when
Dan
Dorfman
,
a
financial
columnist
with
USA
Today
,
has
n't
returned
his
phone
calls
,
he
leaves
messages
with
Mr.
Dorfman
's
office
saying
that
he
has
an
important
story
on
Donald
Trump
,
Meshulam
Riklis
or
Marvin
Davis
.

I
will
try
my
best
to
make
sure
you
remember
these
things
even
after
I
am
gone
.

Eh
and
at
this
time
we
were
asked
why
we
did
that
.

``
We
still
have
serious
differences
with
the
text
,
''
a
British
official
said
,
because
it
provides
for
a
``
regulation
of
the
labor
market
.
''

Reducing

So
Micaiah
answered
,
``
I
can
see
the
army
of
Israel
scattered
all
over
the
hills
,
like
sheep
with
no
one
to
lead
them
.

I
am
not
in
favor
of
that
I
must
say
.

Then
the
Babylonian
army
that
was
with
Nebuzaradan
pulled
down
the
walls
around
Jerusalem
.

The
other
thing
we
need
to
do
is
expand
the
deposit
idea
.

So
..
here
's
a
concluding
thought
.

But
Taiwanese
companies
are
inexperienced
in
this
area
,
and
sending
products
overseas
for
quality
certification
tests
is
time
consuming
and
complicated
,
so
local
companies
can
only
stand
and
watch
as
the
entire
market
goes
to
imported
products
.

The
IMF
also
made
a
new
forecast
for
trends
in
world
trade
in
commodities
and
labor
.

She
,
eh
,
is
the
German
Chinese
Graef
.

He
suggested
that
if
no
accord
was
reached
on
Jerusalem
,
Palestinians
should
be
granted
10
%
of
the
West
Bank
under
an
interim
agreement
,
but
the
Palestinians
are
seeking
a
permanent
peace
deal
that
would
grant
them
independence
and
East
Jerusalem
as
their
capital
.

And
what
about
us
?

It
's
all
speculation
right
now
,
but
what
's
true
is
that
it
is
easy
to
become
a
target
in
this
city
of
200,000
inhabitants
.

Amid

Maurice
Lippens
also
warned
in

that
a

in

out

could
leave
speculators
with

on

When

order
,
he
put
Paul
and
Silas
far
inside
the
jail
and
bound
their
feet
between
large
blocks
of
wood

It
was
all

to
be

they
probably
would
have
gotten
away
with
it

had
they
not

up
unhappy

off

Those

who
were

to
be
important
did
not
change
the
Good
News
message
I
tell
people
.

Some
of
these
are
used
for
special
purposes
,
others
for
ordinary
jobs
.

A
defiant
Mr.
Milosevic
made
his
first
public
appearance
since
being
deposed
in
a
popular
uprising
last
month
.

In
the
past
,
however
,
Coke
has
typically
taken
a
minority
stake
in
such
ventures
.

Since

No

all

have
flourished
here

The

So
,
one
analyst
said
,
even
though
the
long

production
problems
may
be
easing
,
there
will
still
be
a
significant

over

when

will
remain

Defense
experts

joint

are

squeezed

the
desire

some
also
fear
rising
protectionism

she

According
to
reports
from
the
"
Star
Newspaper
"
of
South
Africa
,
on
the
12th
the
African
National
Assembly
of
South
Africa
and
the
South
Africa
government
made
a
large
breakthrough
in
resolving
the
disagreement
on
both
sides
on
the
issue
of
the
African
National
Assembly
stopping
armed
conflict
.

The
fever
for
money
management
has
in
fact
disrupted
the
lives
of
many
people
,
and
brought
a
lot
of
headaches
.

17
sailors
were
killed
.

The
man
was
one
of
six
Palestinians
killed
in
Friday
clashes
with
Israeli
troops
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
.

Observers
at
home
and
around
the
world
were
waiting
and
wondering
-
would
he
address
the
"
one
China
"
issue
?

I
think
we
have
to
continue
to
support
it
,
but
there
no
longer
seems
to
be
any
urgency
about
grabbing
Milosevic
.

At
a
news
conference
last
May
announcing
plans
for
the
auction
,
Sotheby
's
estimated
its
value
in
excess
of
$
100
million
.

I
feel
that
for
many
years
there
have
been
problems
with
the
work
orientation
of
the
Earthquake
Administration
.

But
beginning
now
,
the
Son
of
Man
will
sit
at
the
right
side
of
God

It
's
sad

He
also
taught
about
animals
,
birds
,
and
snakes

He
believed
in
the
merger
like
most
other

did

All
of
this
comes
as
the
USS
Cole
is
being
carried
home
,

destroyer
carried
home
on
the
deck
of
a
larger

As
for
the
government
,
it
is
responsible
for
the
security
of
Iraq
as
a
whole
;
so
when
the
Al
-
Sadr
current
announced
its
position
,
it
was
asking
the
government
to
have
the
power
in
controlling
the
security
situation
,
and
it
has
the
bigger
role
in
receiving
the
security
dossier
.

Only
half
the
New
York
small
businesses
surveyed
,
for
their
part
,
are
satisfied
with
the
police
response
they
receive
.

After
the
lawyer
came
,
he
explained
these
things
to
me
,
he
said
,
the
credit
union
has
already
filed
suit
against
you
.

Thrift
regulators
did
n't
give
any
figures
on
their

actions

They
wanted
to
be
baptized

In
whatever
difficult
environment
,
Taiwan
will
be
like
a
selfless
,
loving
mother

who
never
stops
giving
her
children
opportunities
and
who
helps
them
realize
beautiful
dreams
.

There
was
one
officer
who
always
stayed
close
by
the
king
to
help
him
.

Rehoboam
and
Jeroboam
were
always
fighting
against
each
other
.

But
Jesus
said
to
them
,
``
You
people
are
from
here
below
,
but
I
am
from
above
.

You
should
owe
nothing
to
anyone
,
except
that
you
will
always
owe
love
to
each
other
.

However
,
says
Lin
with
a
laugh
,
things
did
n't
go
exactly
as
she
expected
.

Moreover
,
often
even
the
best
information
and
analysis
is
no
match
for
sheer
luck
.

They
are
in
exactly
the
same
boat
as

If
the

economic
recession
would
indeed
affect
our
export
,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
a
bad
thing
in
the
author
's
view
.

He
started
with
the
books
of
Moses
and
then
he
talked
about
what
the
prophets
had
said
about
him
.

Jesus
said
to
her
,
``
You
are
right

that
is
worn
out

outlived
its

This

is
it

have

and
those
collecting

I
'll
tell
you
that

The
king
of
Israel
sent
a
message
to
his
men
at
the
place
that
the
man
of
God
warned
him
about
.

But
Jesus
did
not
look
the
same
as
before
he
was
killed
.

The
enemy
soldiers
were
all
around

his
men
escaped

we
should
be
finished
with
the

lessons
about

'd
never
really
done
anything
about

the

and
on
the
other
hand
,
they
accuse
some
Islamic
countries
of
sectarian
provocation
against
Iran
,
as
the
Iranians

their
allies
in

complain
that
there
are
obvious
attempts

I

I

The

reflects
two
factors
that

:
the
reawakening
of
the
abortion
-
rights
movement
as
a
potent
force
after

of
lassitude
,
and
the
ability

arena

king
heard
the
words
of
the
Book
of
the
Law
,
he
tore
his
clothes
to
show
he
was
sad
and
upset
.

A
half
-
dozen
candidates
,
backing
policies
ranging
from
Thatcherism
to
watered

Marxism
,
are
given
a
chance
of
winning
.

If
God
receives
glory
through
him
,
he
will
give
glory
to
the
Son
through
himself
.

He
said
:
"
After
I
came
here
,
it
was
not
simply
martial
arts
practice
every

.

``
The

when
considering
a
merger
deal
,
he
says
.

That
is
why
he
said
,
``
Not
all
of
you
are
clean
.
''

Please
help
us

Are
you
going

South
Korea

Japan

Yes

But
he

win
it

Jesus
told
the

not

anyone
about

KKR

Turns
out

Following

There

But
I
will
make
you
king
of
Israel
.

So
,
now
,
er
,
the
US
Treasury
Department
has
brought
out
an
announcement
,
saying
that
ah
,
the
fake
notes
,
ah
,
produced
by
North
Korea
,
um
,
were
actually
produced
and
circulated
with
the
agreement
of
the
government
,
and
under
the
management
and
control
of
the
government
.

But
recent
polls
indicate
Peres
would
fare
better
than
Barak
against
the
right
-
wing
Likud
Party
candidate
Ariel
Sharon
.

All
these
must
be
properly
resolved
before
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
can
improve
.

The
massive
temblor
,
which
killed
at
least
61
people
,
severed
the
Bay
Bridge
,
a
major
artery
to
the
east
,
and
closed
most
ramps
leading
to
and
from
Highway
101
,
the
biggest
artery
to
the
south
.

He
went
to
the
army
building
and
told
Paul
.

So
the
king
's
wife
did
what
he
said
.

so
that
's
good
you
know

Ed
Stanton
heads
a
U.S.
Coast
Guard
team
,
sent
here
at
Ecuador
's
request
.

This
amounts
to
an
extraordinary
repudiation
of
the
tenure
of
New
York
mayoral
candidate
and
former
U.S.
Attorney
Rudolph
Giuliani
,
who
was
more
inclined
to
gathering
scalps
than
understanding
markets
.

This
happened
because
King
Jeroboam
had
committed
many
sins
and
had
caused
the
Israelites
to
sin
.

You
know
what
our
job
is
?

Debenture
holders
also
will
receive
the
equivalent
of
10
%
of
the
common
stock
in
Chicago
&
North
Western
's
parent
company
.

This
is
important
,
because
there
are
many
people
who
refuse
to
obey
--
people
who
talk
about
worthless
things
and
mislead
others
.

Avondale
Industries
Inc.
,
New
Orleans
,
received
a
$
23
million
contract
from
the
Navy
to
enlarge
by
50

the
capacity
of
an
auxiliary

There

But
Paul
shouted
,
``
Do

Brian
,
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
day
when
we
were
going
to
have
a
final
decision
,
we
were
going
to
know
what
is
the
result
of
the
recount
in
Florida
.

We
will
surely
assist
in
finding
out
who
is
the
murderer
!

Quickly
,
one
of
them
ran
and
got
a
sponge
.

So
we
should
stop
judging
each
other
.

The
Ministry
of
Education
has
already
drawn
up
a
whole
range
of
plans
for
teacher
training
.

Then
they
can
steal
the
things
from
his
house
.

But
he
is
the
one
God
sent
to
be
a
ruler
and
savior
.

As
soon
as
the
decision
was
announced
,
Turkish
Prime
Minister
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
commission
's
recommendation
was
unacceptable
.

Last
year
's
earthquake
may
have
de-stroyed
families
and
toppled
homes
,
but
it
also
brought
people
closer
together
and
created
new
links
between
local
communities
.

With
me
from
Mogadishu
is
our
correspondent
Fahd
Yassin

Allen
confirmed
Abather

story
in

to
me

calling
him
and
Balqes
``
very
helpful
individuals

who
``
risked
their

by

You
were

And
neither
Democrats
nor
Republicans
are
predicting
that

produce

The
new
democratic
government
of
President
Vladimir
Kostunica
agreed
to
give
the
alliance
more
time
before
launching
counter
attacks
to
drive
out
the

Last
night
Cubans
retreated
to
never

before

footage
of
Elian

first

with
President
Fidel

.

So
Paul
left
the
council
meeting
.

And
Mr.
Kleinaitis
says
that
with
80
%
of
its
stock
in
friendly
hands
,
Manville
is
the
rare
publicly
traded
company
that
can
ignore
short
-
term
stock
fluctuations
and
plan
for
the
long
haul
.

Factory
payrolls
and
production
fell
in
September
,
and
the
auto
industry
and
housing
are
in
a
severe
crunch
.

All
the
people
thanked
the
king
,
said
goodbye
,
and
went
home
.

Even
the
Soviet
Union
has
Peter
the
Great
to
rediscover
,
should
it
choose
to
.

An
angry
reaction
spread
throughout
the
city
,
and
everyone
came
running
to
the
Temple
.

But
with
no
reports
of
either
country
actually
entering
the
market
,
analysts
said
,
futures
prices
became
vulnerable
.

But
in
1986
Congress
sharply
reduced
the
number
of
people
who
could
qualify
for
its
benefits
and
IRA
tax
-
deductions
slowed
their
roaring
growth
.

Oh
,
you
offended
the
accused
.

And
you
were
the
one
who
brought
Israel
back
home
from
war
.

He
also
covered
the
cedar
altar
with
gold
.

This
,
from
what
we
've
seen
during
our
campaign
,
prices
vary
.

Forgive
our
sins
,
just
as
we
forgive
everyone
who
has
done
wrong
to
us
.

God
gave
us
this
command
:
If
we
love
God
,
we
must
also
love
each
other
as
brothers
and
sisters
.

This
is
one
of
them
.

Dealers
attributed
most
of
the
day
's
gains
to
market
-
makers
moving
prices
higher
,
rather
than
an
outbreak
of
significant
buying
interest
.

The
time
came
for
David

so
he
gave

Saddened

As
a

we
do

much

food

it

such
an

that
the

Mr.

,
by
the
way
,
has
decreed
another
NIH
investigation
of

adding
to

investigations

Some
still
harbor
the

ideal
of
the
era
of
educated
youth
,
with
uncured
masochism
left
from

Old

And
Afghanistan
really
represents
something
that

a

Islamic
values

They
do

This

statements

here
in

the
mention
of

The
next
day

decided
to
go

Before

action
,
he
advised

to
``
see
what
the
market
has
produced

Therefore
,

in
such
a

lately
by
a
social
case
as
much
as
it
has
been
