At

the

Bottom

report

this

In

it

at
this
point
the

perhaps

It

appear
that

was
welcomed
by

on

I
went
directly
to
discussing

term
annual
forecast
,
it
was
July
14

I
put
it
down
on

read
the

then
I
reported

two

the
glittering

in
the
crown

the
story
I
try
to
tell
about

have
brought
us
to
this

seems

have

,
in

the
cumulative
effect
of
making
Mr.

``
appear
more
arrogant

less
sensitive

shallower

Similarly
,
after
the
recent
spate
of
forest
fires
in
central

southern

Odds
and
Ends

Many
people
had
come
out
of

city
to
see
all
this
.

The
Securities
and
Futures
Commission
,
a
government
watchdog
set
up
after
the
1987
crash
to
try
to
restore
confidence
and
order
to
Hong
Kong

markets
,
had
been
expected
to
give

conditional
approval
last
week

"
Buy
me
,
"
this
mustachioed
and
smiling
deity
of
wealth
seems
to
be
saying
.

Concerned
by
dipping
demand
for
its
traditional
products
,
it
is
moving
not
only
into
blonde
cigarettes
,
but
also
into
electronic
car

parking
payment
cards
to
be
sold
in
neighborhood

Situations
received
up
until
now
were
that
the
top
floor
of

School
in
Liangping
County
,
Chongqing
collapsed
,
injuring
over
10
students
with
two
suffering
from
serious
injuries
;.

If
you
do
this
,
you
will
be
children
who
are
truly
like
your
Father
in
heaven

I
informed
Operations
of
the
incident
,
that
they
were
in

of
me
at
the
time
,
and
that
there
was

All
the
people

buried

the
lack
of
lines
became
painfully
apparent

and
you
wo
n't
believe
the
results

Some

While
admitting

Judge

told
a

filled

dozen
attorneys
that
he
was
concerned
about
the
toll
mounting
legal
bills

take
on
Mr.

about
the
fact
that
,
following

by

,
none
of

plans
appeared
to
be
viable
in
their
present
form

The
agreement
issued
in

early
hours
of
the

:
an

its

step
,

troops
is
to
be
critically
deployed
in
the
region
3
kilometers
from
the
center
of
Gorazde
City
so
as
to
monitor
the
cease
-
fire
situation
of
the
both
sides
involved
in
the
war
;
the
Serb
side
is
to
hand
over
its
heavy
weapons
directly
to
the
care
of
the
United
Nations
peacekeeping
troops
or
withdraw
to
a
region
which
can
not
threaten
the
safety
zone
of
Gorazde
;
safety
is
to
be
provided
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
wounded
from
the
city
,
and
completely
free
passage
is
to
be
ensured
for
all

of

humanitarian
aid
personnel

Ms.

made
a
passionate

but
she
was
talking

Mr.

notes
that
these
types
of

also
are
``
sophisticated

enough
not

complain
about

use
of

So
the
officials
just
returned
her

But
Director
Ba
,
as
an
intellectual
who
always
spoke
the
truth
and
stood
up
for
what
was
right

should
have
known
that
the

Unfortunately

the

there

nothing

those

To

because
of
the

the

the
doors

Last
week
,
the
strategy
of
playing
the
two
experts
off
each
other
blew
up
:
Mr.
Lawson
quit
in
exasperation
and
Sir
Alan
Walters
,
the
adviser
,
announced
his
resignation
within
an
hour
.

I
want
to
see
what
he
has
to
say
.

Jason
Hu
,
formerly
foreign
minister
and
now
director
of
the
Department
of
Cultural
Affairs
in
the
KMT
,
warns
that
the
US
is
already
leaning
toward
the
PRC
in
the
trilateral
relationship
.

Thus
Cheng
concludes
that
the
inclusion
of
gravel
must
have
been
deliberate
.

Have
you
ever
been
subpoenaed
in
a
like
similar
case
where
someone
said
something
to
you
that
you
may
have
reported
or
not
reported
?

that
'll
be
a
big
break
for
you
guys
then

When
Abijah
died
,
he
was
buried
in
the
City
of
David
.

They
were
very
happy
to
see
it
again
.

I
think
there
are
two
questions
involved
in
this
matter
.

In
this
respect
,
it
would
be
helpful
if
our
political
leaders
were
mute
,
rather
than
eloquently
``
concerned
.
''

I
guess
I
was
working
part
time
that
year
doing
part
time
counseling
jobs

The
presence
of
so
many
people
,
cars
and
competing
businesses
is
evidence
of
a
healthy
economy
in
a
place
where
people
want
to
live
.

Do
n't
think
these
little
children
are
not
important
.

He
also
invited
Abiathar
the
priest
and
Joab
,
the
commander
of
your
army
,
but
he
did
not
invite
your
faithful
son
Solomon
.

In
fact
,
ah
,
Chinese
overseas
students
being
cheated
in
Canada
is
not
accidental
.

In
the
middle
of
the
lake
,
besides
a
couple
of
slowly
moving
pleasure
boats
,
there
was
also
the
reflection
of
a
group
of
hills
,
rising
and
falling
.

Turnover
remained
relatively
small
.

In
the
middle
of
the
night
?

and
I
think
that
's
what
it
is
yeah
sure.
because
the
minute
I
got
here
I
relaxed
completely

The
ministry
has
nothing
to
do
with
prosecution
.

He
heard
about
the
bad
things
his
sons
were
doing
to
the
Israelites
at
Shiloh
and
how
his
sons
were
having
sexual
relations
with
the
women
who
served
at
the
door
of
the
Meeting
Tent
.

I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
will
happen
with
Judge
Alito
.

And
the
soldiers
took
the
best
sheep
and
cattle
to
sacrifice
to
the
Lord
your
God
at
Gilgal
.

I
really
do

%hm
so
they
're
living
with
him
?

And
in
the
memo
he
says
yes
clearly
ah
they
have
access
to
FBI
or
justice
department
sources
.

As
for
the
outflow
of
trained
personnel
,
most
employees
of
domestic
banks
have
been
stirred
into
an
frenzy
by
the
media
and
can
hardly
sit
still
as
they
wait
for
the
day
they
will
be
enlisted
.

The
death
toll
in
Colombia
from
three
days
of
heavy
fighting
between
soldiers
and
rebels
there
now
stands
at
more
than
100
.

One
of
four
men
on
trial
in
the
bombings
of
two
U.S.
embassies
in
Africa
is
asking
the
judge
to
throw
out
his
confession
.

Unemployment
is
widespread
in
the
society
.

The
bonds
are
rated
double
-
A
by
Moody

and
double

A
-
minus
by

.

Grinch

so
we
need
to
go
to
that
step
as
well
.

part
of
a

38

syndicate
that

more
it
is
expected
to
be

Moreover
,
and
here
Judge
Oakes
went
to
the
heart
of
the
question
,
``
Responsible
biographers
and
historians
constantly
use
primary
sources
,
letters
,

,
and

feared

On

That

your

on

I
do

anything

you
are

a

For

Second
,
over-indebted
American
consumers
with
their
insufficient
savings
are
using
their
increasingly
overvalued
houses

support
their
excessive
consumption
;
and
now
housing
prices
are
turning
soft
,
people
are
losing
their

the

that

took
bread

gave

and
minority
areas

Direct

were

alarmed
when

Last
night
an
angel
came
to
me
from
God
--
the
God
I
worship
and
belong
to
.

I
'd
slept
through
my
only
previous
brush
with
natural
disaster
,
a
tornado
15

so
summers

to
such
things
:
the
urge
to
talk
about
them
.

In

been
making
great
efforts
to
further
improve
the
investment
environment
and
has
achieved
significant
progress
and
strengthened
its
appeal

,
bond
prices
will
start
to
climb
on
the
prospects
that
the

allow
interest
rates

move
lower
in

Show
us
which
one
of
these
two
men
you
choose

do
this
work

By
2004
,
due
to
the
pressure
from
various
parties
,
with
no
loans
from
banks
,
a
shortage
of
fluid
funds
and
cash
problems
,
the
person
in
charge
had
no
choice
but
to
register
demutualization
in
the
name
of
a
dozen

Human
rights
groups
are
criticizing
an
agreement
between

Young
people
,
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
too
.

What
if
the
choice
is
between
a
larger
home
and
an
SUV
in
the
exurbs
or
a
smaller
home
and
maybe
no
car
in
the
inner
areas
,
AND
AT
A
HIGHER
PRICE
,
including
travel
?

alright
,

It
's
all
in
this

you
do
n't
want
to
look
at
.

But
these
leaders
saw
that
God
had
given
me
a
special
work
,
the
same
as
Peter
.

The
paper
that

Russian
officials
say
a
suicide
bomber
drove
a
truck
packed
with
explosives
into
government
buildings
in
Chechnya
.

When
U.S.

began
,
Treasury
bonds
received
an
additional
boost
from
news
that
sales
of
new
single
-
family
homes
fell
14
%
in
September
.

Many
of
the
letters
maintain
that
investor
confidence
has
been
so
shaken
by
the
1987
stock
market
crash
--
and
the
markets
already
so
stacked
against
the
little
guy
--
that
any
decrease
in
information
on
insider
-
trading
patterns
might
prompt
individuals
to
get
out
of
stocks
altogether
.

In
September
,
after
the
army
and
people
of
the
Central
Soviet
Area
crushed
KMT
's
third
encirclement
,
the
two
parts
to
the
south
of
Jiangxi
province
and
the
west
of
Fujian
province
were
joined
together
and
the
base
was
expanded
to
more
than
30
counties
.

We
're
putting
banks
and
financial
institutions
around
the
world
uh
on

In

of
Man

I
send
it

you
on

paper

Do
n't
speak
proud
words
,
because
the
Lord
God
knows
everything

I
would
say
that
US
officials
and
Iraqi
officials
are
looking
for
the
right
people
in
the
Sunni
community
to
talk
to
in
order
to
insure
that
the
Sunni
Arab
community
becomes
part
of
the
political
process
.

Israeli
sources
say
Sharon
will
repeat
his
position
that
the
Palestinians
must
first
crack
down
on
Islamic
militant
groups
,
like

.

and
then
I
called

the

Such

If
these

people
dislike
Taiwan
,
their
opinions
will
get
passed
around
by

The
crowds
focused
much
of
their

on
anything
associated

I
could
do
with
it
what
I
want

By
2010
,
the
gross
volume
of
foreign
trade
of
the

hopefully
reach
800

which
will
undoubtedly
increase
the
demand

By
contrast
Castro
has
strictly
limited
the
media
's
access
to
the
boy
,
but
that
policy
seems
to
have
changed
now
with
foreign
reporters
invited
to
attend
Elian
's
birthday
party
today
in
his
hometown
of
Cardinas
,
Cuba
.

You
know
I
just
wonder
whether
the
same
people
that-

When
the
town
hall
made
plans
to
rip
up
the
stone
steps
on
the
long
pathway
leading
up
the
mountainside
at
Hsiuluan
Park
and
replace
them
with
imported
stone
,
local
citizens
protested
,
asking
the
town
hall
to
leave
the
steps
as
they
were
.

The
farmer
is
like
someone
who
plants
God
's
teaching
in
people
.

The
Cole
will
take
the
long
way
home
,
around
the
southern
tip
of
Africa
,
avoiding
the
Suez

because
of
ongoing
terrorist
threats
.

Sales
rose
4.2
%
to
$
3.31
billion
from
$
3.2
billion
.

The
three
units
had
combined
1988
sales
of
about
$
904
million
.

Even
outmoded
warlords
like
Yan
Xishan
in
Shanxi
,
or
Long
Yun
in
Yunnan
,
or
Wu
Peifu
could
not
be
won
over.

Then
try
to
tell
me
that
shutting
down
the
state
government
is
n't
going
to
be
noticed
by
the
average
citizen
.

We
know
that
we

Using
the
Scriptures
,
those
who
serve
God
will
be
prepared
and
will
have
everything
they
need
to
do
every
good
work
.

I
think
it
prompted
her

get
married
.

So
they
joined

Like

The

part
of
the
transaction
will
see

For

is
Hawtat

Today
there
can
be
no
return
to
any
discussion
table
or
dialog
table
to
discuss
matters
that
have
become
part
of
the
past
.

But
what
will
happen
if
that
servant
is
evil
and
thinks
his
master
will
not
come
back
soon
?

And
some
U.S.
Army
analysts
worry
that
the
proposed
Soviet
redefinition
is
aimed
at
blocking
the
U.S.
from
developing
lighter
,
more
transportable
,
high
-
technology
tanks
.

I
do
n't
agree
with
what
that
says
.

Specifically
,
he
wants
to
know
if
other
officers
in
the
chain
of
command
above
the
ship
's
captain
should
be
held
accountable
for
security
lapses
.

Prior
to
the
holding
of
six
party
talks
on
the
North
Korea
nuclear
issue
,
uh
,
Japan
requested
that
North
Korea
must
abandon
its
nuclear
program
and
meanwhile
,
must
also
resolve
the
hostage
issue
between
Japan
and
North
Korea
.

He
said
that
even
though
virtually
all
corn
seeds
currently
planted
are
hybrids
,
the
genetic
approach
will
obviate
the
need
for
mechanical
emasculation
of
anthers
,
which
costs
U.S.
seed
producers
about
$
70

Her
Institute
for
Family
and
Work
Relationships
in
La
Jolla
,
Calif.
,
has
noted
a
doubling
in
the
number
of
couples
seeking

past
two

Because
they
thought
that
they
went

Crawl

When
Mr.
Pilson
is
asked
directly
--
can
you
make
money
on
all
this
?--
he
does
n't
exactly
say
yes.

Never
do
anything
evil
.

I
do
not
believe
that
one
possesses
a
strong
personality
by
nature
,
but
one
does
possess
the
basics
.

Learning
the
true
identities
of
those
involved
in
the
bombing
would
help
answer
that
question
,
but
the
two
suicide
bombers
died
in
the
attack
,
and
after
the
explosion
,
the
man
who
lived
behind
the
blue
door
simply
vanished
.

For
the
science
of
earthquake
observation
,
maybe
experts
believe
neither
toads
crossing
the
street
nor
birds
flushing
are
reliable
,
nor
are
ants
climbing
trees
,
mice
moving
,
fish
jumping
over
the
pond
,
and
abnormal
behaviors
of
cats
and
dogs
.

When
only
civil
liability
is
involved
,
this
method
has
the
undeniable
strengths
of
factual
specificity
and
avoidance
of
overgeneralization
.

And
in
20
years
,
what
we
know
today
will
be
only
one
percent
of
the
total
knowledge
bank
of
our
children
!

While

With
regard
to
Russia
's
repeated
extortion
and
elbowing
out
of
the
Chinese
in
fact
we
ca
n't
find
any
other
more
accurate
or
appropriate
terms
for
it
,

Chinese
government
,
in
its
recorded
negotiations
with
the
Russians
,
has
never
told
us
anything
workable
for
this
situation

When
these

happen
,

that
great
blessings
belong
to
you

Now
that
Rove

in

been
caught

handed
peddling
this

have
respect
for
the
sanctity
of

They
also
give

Thus
,
the

was
born

No

not

walked
off

But
,
at
some
point
,
there
is
a
question
of
basic
equity
that
must
be
answered
:

Doctor
Imad

I

,
until

Another

gathered
momentum
as
he
rolled

You
're
simply
saying
that
you

it

something
that

``
I
believe
it

legitimize

Curtin
Windsor
,
who
served
as

ambassador
to
Costa

during
the
Reagan

.

These
are
all
differently
wired

He
was
not
put

Nonetheless
,
the
suit
seeks
unspecified
damages
that
an
attorney
for
Quickview
claimed
could
run
into
the
millions
of

.

The
Colombian
Army
says

have
wiped

Currently

It
all
started
with
two
Stanford
PhD
students
looking
for
a
way
to
categorize

online
,
who
came
up
with
a
great
idea
for
a
way
to
make
finding
information
easier
for
Internet
users
.

Ms.
Lin
,
who
turned
40
this
year
,
says
with
an
air
of
resignation
that
if
a
gust
of
wind
blows
the
whole
puzzle
away
,
the
sense
of
dismay
and
panic
at
being
tricked
by

can
drive
you
to
distraction

In

with
America

long
history

propping
up
Mr.

recent

extended
rather
than
shortened
his
survival

Industry
analysts
have
said
that
the

high

Mr.

who
was

and
in
California
state
court
of
unlawful
use
of
the
telephone
to
defraud

deceive

is
now
on
probation
.

I
tried
to
destroy
his

During
Asa

time
there
were
men
who
served
other
gods
by
selling
their
bodies
for

.

Of
course
,
there
are
many
areas
in
which
I
am
also
dissatisfied
naturally
with
the
service
of
domestic
banks
.

God
,
with
his
mercy
,
gave
us
this
work
to
do
,
so
we
do
n't
give
up.

Several
engineering

the

And
so
you
will
escape

that
comes

what
do
you

do
n't
you

have
made

come

One
of
my
greatest
impressions
of
such
major
shows
as
the
Paris
Auto
Show
--
later
I
read
a
People
's
Daily
editorial
,
ah
,
written
by
a
reporter
--there
were
no
auto
showgirls
.

This
was
during
the
27th
year
that
Asa
was
king
in
Judah
.

But
do
n't
treat
them
as
enemies
.

He
broke
all
the
memorial
stones

Asherah

In

I
was
thinking
of
her
this
morning
.

I
know
a
guy
who
gets
surplus
building
materials
sorts
and
resells
it
.

Unfortunately
,
these
things
were
weak
in
the
beginning
,
but
they
have
grown
now
and
reached
the
level
they
reached
because
of
security
weakness
and
indecisiveness
toward
such
issues
,
which
have
become
a
daily
reality
before
our
eyes
.

Mr.
Bush
himself
essentially
acknowledged
that
he
and
his
aides
were
trying
to
head
off
criticism
.

Ms.
Slater
reports
on
personal
finance
from
The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
New
York
bureau
.

But
President
Bush
is
expected
to
veto
the
congressional
legislation
and
that
,
along
with
the
easy
approval
of
the
Pennsylvania
measure
,
is
likely
to
mute
the
abortion
-
rights
activists
'
claims
of
momentum
and
underline
the
challenges
faced
by
this
resurgent
movement
.

Did
n't
notice
it
.

One
,
eh
,
was
what
is
called
TSI
,
which
was
brought
on
this
occasion
.

She
had
been
married
to
Herod

Philip
,
but

married

Some

noted
that
nervousness
over
the

sharp
dive
in

could
intensify
following
suggestions
by

The
most
striking
example
yesterday
may
have
been
in
community
development

,
where
the
two
houses
had
separately
approved
a
total
of
27
projects
valued
at
$
20
million
,
and
the
conference
added
15
more
valued
at
$
8
million
to
ostensibly
preserve
``
balance

between
the
House

Oncogenes

become
malignant

but
researchers
have
found

suggesting
that
oncogenes
do

cause
cancer

So
I
never
know
about
these
things

for
when

talk

come
into

Near
the
Guanggu

,
a
fruit
stand
merchant
was
getting
ready
to
stop

Nobody
proved
that
more
masterfully
than
Mr.

if
it

anything
other

that
insist
that
you

then
next

I
'll
do
nine

a

then
eight
then
nine

That
's
a
dichotomy

They
would
say
,
'
This

what

Officials

counter
that

Now
the
newspapers
,
which
I
do
not
trust
,
still
declare
that
inequality
in

is
the
reason
.

Imperial
said
in

it

be
filed
in
the

watered
down
from
last

It

a
tough

And
I
am
about

After
winning
a
school
competition
with
a
performance
of
the
latter
's
``
Violin
Concerto
,
''
Mr.
McDuffie
was
invited
to
play
the
work
for
the
composer
,
who
was
dying
of
cancer
.

Friday
's
plunge
,
he
is
telling
PaineWebber
brokers
,
was
nothing
more
than
a
``
tremendous
reaction
to
leveraged
buy
-
out
stocks
.
''

Is
that
where
John
Bolton
learned
how
to
be
so
belligerent
down
there
in
uh-

but
if
you
make
it
sound
like
you
want
to
do
it
then
she
'll
probably
agree
.

They
will
damage
South
Korea

We

Making
use
of
the
network
of
operating
branch
organizations
and
the
dominance
of
a
commercial
bank
distributed
all
over
the
country
,
and
entrusting
policy
financial
business
to
a
commercial
bank
to
act
for
it
,
is
an
efficient
way
to
alleviate
the
above
mentioned
problems
.

Can
trouble
or
problems
or
persecution
separate
us
from
his
love
?

Bob
Chandross
,
chief
economist
at
Lloyds
Bank
in
New
York
,
also
noted
that
the
pound
's
sharp
decline
is
pegged
more
to
uncertainty
in
the
market
than
a
vision
of
altered
United
Kingdom
economic
policies
.

This
would
make
the
market
-
oriented
system
more
attractive
to
Eastern
countries
,
they
argue
,
and
allow
greater
economic
aid
and
technological
know
-
how
to
flow
from
West
to
East
.

For
example
,
the
Small
Business
Administration
has
had
reasonable
success
in
reducing
both
guarantee
rates
and

He
said
that
Israel
did
not
have
any
ambitions
there
,
and
its
aim
was
to
deter
Hezbollah
.

I
immediately
wondered
if
the
grade
of
this
steel
reinforced
concrete
was
up
to
standard
?

Many
farmers
used
the
jump
in
prices
to
sell
their
recently
harvested
crop
to
grain
elevator
companies
.

But
the
followers
did
not
know
it
was
Jesus
.

In
my
home
region
,
Latin
America
,
much
of
the
existing
infrastructure
base
--
an
important
building
block
for
development
--
has
been
financed
by
the
World
Bank
.

The
two
nations
are
still
bitter
enemies
.

``
The
development
could
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
farm
production
,
especially
cotton
,

Murray
Robinson
,
president
of
Delta
&
Pine
Land
Co.
,
a
Southwide
Inc.
subsidiary
that
is
one
of
the
largest
cotton
seed
producers
in

This
is
one
case
where
they
have
turned
a
blind
eye
to
what
's
going
on
in
professional
sports
.

This
was
also
done
in
all
foreign
championships
in
which
the
team
participated
.

Later
,
Jesus
appeared
to
the
eleven
followers
while
they
were
eating

Now

I
'm
amazed
at
how
unaffected
I
am
by

how
I
'm
still
coming
to

doing
the

going

it
just
seems
so
strange
to
me
that
it

almost
a
parallel

I
think
,
in

that
if

non-existent

Um
,
in

,
er
,
this
time
of

,
the

had
put

it

You

that

At

in

,
the
deputy

of

,
in

,
finally
arrived

.

Only
two

Nien

and
Ritek

It
does
n't
get
more
shocking
than
this
.

Outside
,
I
spotted
two
young
men
lugging
blocks
of
concrete
.

Either
way
it
was
a
pity
,
because
Mr.

offered
the
most
substantial

of

just

The
Fed
would
eliminate
the
cause
of
the
potential
panic
rather
than
attempting
to
treat
the
symptom
--
the
liquidity
of
the
banks
.

Recently
,
the
US
Congress
passed
an
inter-state
banking
law
,
allowing
regional

``
Maybe
this
will
jolt
us
out
of
the
post-Vietnam
syndrome
that
we
never
are
prepared
to
use
force
,
''
he
says
.

Yeah
But
David
Golden
that
's
going
to
be
a
hard
argument
to
make
,
right
?

The
share
of
the
domestic
market
of
the
products
and
the
percent
coverage
of
the
kinds
of
products
reached
70
%
and
90
%
,
respectively
.

Such
a
kind
of
bosses
are
even
more
fierce
than
those
who
are
"
hereditary
".

It
's
simply
the
right
time
to
do
what
we
are
doing
,
''
Mr.

As

with

the

of
America
--
said
they
would
not
proceed
with
condemnation
proceedings
while
there
was
``

''
pending
.

and
then
I
saw
it

Just
really
briefly
.

and
I
'm
on
the
way
up
there
kind
of
meandering
up
to
the
states
and
seeing
anybody
and
everybody
.

So
uh
as
devastating
as
it
is
you
're
really
kind
of
fortunate
because
once
you
take
out
the
plaster
,
once
you
take
out
the
insulation
make
sure
that
the
inside
of
the
building
is
dry
uh
the
foundation
is
dry
you
can
really
start
the
rebuilding
process

that

that

with

I
issued
the
prediction

The
time
is
coming

will

The

At
age
65
,
when
I
'd
stop
paying
premiums
,
the
Ameritas
offering
would
have
a
projected
cash
value
$
14,000
higher
than
the
other
,
even
though
the
Equitable

policy
illustration
assumed
a
fractionally
higher
interest
rate

There
is
a
sense
of
I
think
increasing
despondency
in
the
country
as
we
continue
on
this
.

Yeah
I
went
there
on
vacation
this
summer
.

Not
only
does
this
come
close
to
a
violation
of
law
,
it
violates
the
trust
we
have
all
worked
to
develop

According
to
what
well

sources
revealed
,
the

arming

But
no
one
can
control
the
tongue
.

``
But
Sassy
has
a
different
spirit

The
ordinary
people
will
call
us
a
few
bad
names
,
when
it
becomes
worse
,
we
bow
and
leave
the
stage

And

And
if
anyone
takes
away
from

words

of

,
God
will
take
away

Consider
,
for

,
the
very
fat
fowl
known

She
had
a
golden
cup
in

We
are
,
as
I
said

confident

based
on
not

also
the
level
of
cooperation
,
the
record
keeping
that
we
reviewed
and
so
forth
,
that
we
have
all
of
the
bats

The
outstanding
example
of
this
was
the
motorist
on
the
Bay

who
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
take
out
a
video
camera
at
the
absolutely
crucial
moment

record
the
car
in
front
as
it
fell
into

There

the
existing

have
not

enough

support

result
that
these

are
now
resorting

assessing
additional

the

what
happened
at
that
meeting
?

You
must

As
Ross

reports

of
this

from

company

Hartford

Conn.
,
headquarters
for
additional
training
on
how
to
handle
major
catastrophes
,
including
earthquakes
.

Will
this
perhaps
positively
be
reflected
now
that
Bolton
has
left
with
his
hard
line
policy
and
even
his
way
of
talking
about
various
issues
?

But
this
raises
added
cost
barriers
to
urban
entrepreneurship
.

In
principle
also
,
all
the
political
mediations
which
were
widely
talked
about
yesterday
morning
,
were
voided
by
nighttime
,
because
the
calculations
of
the
minority
or
the
opposition
do
not
correspond
at
all
with
those
of
the
majority
or
the
loyalists
.

This
is
understandable
.

They
do
not
even
have
any
interest
in
education
or
in
establishing
strong

in

They
said
,
``

caught
up

peaked

there

at

than
Mr.

He

talking

very

says
a

leery

only

I

because
I
think
,
you
know
,
at
first
we
were
talking
about
that
trying
to
work
it
in
with
the
festival

Mr.
Sherman
is
a
professor
of
criminology
at
the
University

um
Thanks
to
both
of
you
for
coming
on
the
program
.

But
you
are
telling
them
to
hit
me
,
and
that
is
against

According
to
presentations
,
it
has
been
15
years
now
since
1982
,
when
China
first
issued
overseas
debt
.

In
Africa
,
last
year
the
PRC
tried
very
hard
to
get
Taiwan
's
eight
diplomatic
partners
on
that
continent
to
participate
in
the

Sino

African
Cooperation
Forum

held
in

Capitalism
may
now
be
engineered
to
withstand
sudden
shocks
,
but
there
are
fault
lines
--
the
crisis
in
profits
,
the
assault
on
wages
,
the
structural
inequity
of
the
system
--that
make
fools
of
those
who
claim
that
the
future
is
here
and
that
history
is
over
.

As
the
Scriptures
say
,
``
God
caused
the
people
to
fall
asleep

When
all
else
fails
,
Gucci
Gulch
--
the
fabled
halls
of
the
Capitol
inhabited
by
lobbyists

their
imported

--
offers
a
welcome
environment
for
fallen
officials
.

Give
us
the
food
we
need
for
each
day
.

It
could
work
.

I
am
Gregor
Cragey

Said
the
spokeswoman
:
``
The
whole
structure
has
changed
.

Let
's
take
a
look
at
who
most
people
think
of
when
they
think
of
Deep
Throat
.

God
is
the
one
who
gave
us
the
law
,
and
he
is
the
Judge
.

He
will
compensate
with
the
guile
learned
from
his
years
in
the
majors
.

I
was
in
30
states
I
think
last
year
,
on
behalf
of
Republican
candidates
and
I
tend
to
do
a
lot
of
campaigning
in
the
next
year
for
the
President

At

two

Laboratories
Inc.

Kennewick

Wash.
,
and
Novametrix
Medical
Systems
Inc.

Wallingford
,
Conn.
,
now
sell
versions
of
the
magnetic

.

If
Mr.
McDonough
's
plans
get
executed
,
as
much
of
the
Polish
center
as
possible
will
be
made
from
aluminum
,
steel
and
glass
recycled
from
Warsaw
's
abundant
rubble
.

The
insurgency
is
in
a
no

win
position
.

There
we
receive
mercy
and
kindness
to
help
us
when
we
need
it
.

As
a
young
girl
she
helped
with
the
tea
work
,
and
later
her
husband
also
cultivated
tea
.

Anna
was
always
at
the
Temple
;
she
never
left
.

Why
wo
n't
the
Russians
help
us
get
sanctions
in
the
United
Nations
against
Iran
and
try
to
stop
them
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
?

The
note
read
:

Though
I
do

we
all

and
at
this
moment
of
calamity
,
we
can
not
refrain
from
extending
a
helping
hand
,
we
must
do
all
we
can
to
console
our
countrymen
who
have
died
tragically
as
well
as
our

how
the

shaping
up
for

according
to

You

I
tell
you
,
when
this
man
finished
his
prayer
and
went
home
,
he
was
right
with
God
.

The
Sadducees
believe
that
after

die
,
they
will
not
live
again

is
no

anyone

Abu

may
God
protect
him

was
harsh
with
the
ministers
and
demanded
work
and
accomplishment
from
them
after
offering
to
each
minister
what
he
needed
.

But
really
,
Jesus
himself
did
not
baptize

his

baptized

the

about
the

at

That

I

the
furore
over
the
cancellation
of

was
briefly
laid
to
rest
on

take
note
,
these

It
got
out

so
this
vote
could
well
be
as
much
a
rejection
of
the
Lazio
campaign
as
it
is
also
a
very
positive
setting
about
Hillary

,
and
you
remember
after
Rick
Lazio
had
pressed
her

said

said

me
of
my

in
some

my

I
do

But

members
and
supporters
of
the

tend
to
speak
in
innuendo
about
the
JSP
's
alleged
donations
,
implying
that
North
Korean
money
would
be
more
suspect
than
South
Korean
because
North
Korea
is
communist
and
South
Korea
is
an

And
while

the
second

Now
I
will
discuss
the
things
you
wrote

about

Because
they
say
Gore
does
not
require
the
kind
of
annual
student
testing

tell

Their
cowardly
acts
of
civil
disobedience
,
which
they
tried
to
hide
under
the
cloak
of
outrage
at
a
war
they
characterized
as
``
immoral
,
''
weakened
the
national
fabric
and
threw
additional
burdens
on
those
who
served
honorably
in
that
conflict

explain
why
one

discolored

You
can
wonder
,
but
then
go
away

quite
reasonable

,
be
carried
forward
,
until
these
projects
for
which
this
large
budget
was
allocated
are
completed
.

and
of

you
're
not

to
approach
them

Once

your

misstates

certainly
are

encouraging

good

I
miss
seeing
people
I
know

Reckoning
all
the
options
,
it
seems
that
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
eliminate
the
ordinary
people
's
ability
to
perceive
,
causing
the
ordinary
people
to
have
absolutely
no
consciousness

any

The

My
position
on
Saudi
Arabia
is
well

known
,
I
have
written
praising
it
for
its
position
towards
the
Palestinian
people
and
their
prime
minister
a
number
of
times
.

Mr.
Ruby
,
39

said
that
he
had
``
an

with
Capital
Holding
and
that
he
has
``
a
number
of
ventures
in

financial

services
area

under
consideration
.

They
would
not
solve
the
problem
;
they
would
make
it
worse
.

In
addition
to
increasing
costs
as
a
result
of
greater
financial
exposure
for
members
,
these
measures
could
have
other
,
far

reaching
repercussions

Uh
let
me
turn
to
the
midterm
elections
where
all
these
things
+invariably
lead
.

But
the
plane
boasts
a
strong
core
of
support
in
the
House
,
where
members
are
intent
on
saving
Grumman

and
are
worried
about
potential
shortages
of
carrier

aircraft
by
the
late

Two

also

with
Mr.

,
this
time
of

The

Nevertheless
,
some
viewers
could
identify
with
the
plot
.

Palestinians
warned
that
Wednesday
,
they
'll
attempt
to
block
the
roads
to
Jewish
settlements

Saddam

was
able

prove
to
the

the
stupidity
of

Near

Following
the
impeachment
conviction
,
Dr.
Benjamin
Hooks
,
executive
director
of
the
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
,
issued
a
restrained
statement
,
warning
that
the
Hastings
case
could
set
a
``
dangerous
precedent
,
''
but
adding
,
``
We
must
respect
the
considered
judgment
of
the
Senate
.

The
company
is
still
negotiating
the
sales
of
the
other
four

and
expects
to
announce

Something

He
even
defeated

Yeh
still
regrets
that
he
did
n't
have

so
he
could

also
make

performances

Everyone

go
home

But
the
Japanese
insist
upon
Japanese
managers
everywhere
they
set
up

.

He
probably
has
n't
done
it
for
the
cash
.

But
,
as
Judge
Kozinski
noted
,
the
context
shows
that
Mr.
Masson
's
``
me
alone
''
remark
referred
not
to
his
alleged
pre-eminence
in
his
profession
but
to
the
fact
that
his
position
on
a
particular
issue
was
not
shared
by
anyone
else
.

In
his
first
detailed
interview
since
he
was
driven
from
power
,
Milosevic
today
told
a
private
Serbian
TV
station
that
his
conscience
is
clear
about
his
years
in
office
,
and
he
denounced
the
International
War
Crimes
Tribunal
as
a
political
institution
which
is
against
the
Serbs
.

He
withdrew
the
remark
.

Currently
,
the
average
scale
of
Taiwanese
capital
corporations
investing
in
Tianjin
has
already
reached
25

high

increased

The

said
,
``
Look

Then
...
nothing
more
until
after
March
,
when
I
came
back
from

I
am

I

What
a

that
has
been
to
me

to
withdraw
from

Later

Joshua
led
our
ancestors
to
capture
the
lands
of

But
I
liked
the
easy
friendliness
of
the
people
around
me
,
liked
it
that
they
'd
brought
their
children
,
found
it
charming
that
,
true
citizens
of
the
state
of
the
future
,
they
had
brought
so
many
TVs
and
radios
to
stay
in
touch
with
electroreality
at
a
live
event
.

Just
recently
she
reflected
on
that

Cosbey

But
then
one
day
I
heard
the
song
"
Rainy
Day
,
"
and
could
n't
believe
that
this
was
a
Blue
Jeans
song
where
they
lay
down
arms
and
turn
romantic
.

But
Peter

So
if

about

And
by
the
way
,
there
were
also
Omanis
with

and
they
completed

These
days
,
Abather
and
his
young
family
are
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Iraqis
who
have
fled
in
fear
for
their
lives
.

Diplomacy
by
coercion
does
n't
work
,
and
both
sides
should
not
make
statements
that
are
likely
to
inflame
.

If
we
multiply
that
by
30
days
,
it
would
be
equivalent
to
the
salary
of
a
Saudi
employee
in
a
phone
kiosk
,
maybe
more
.

"
But
at
one
or
two
thousand

it
's

There
's

said
that
the

to
pump
10

was
made
last
March

Lien
Chan
that
a
large
part
of
the
reason
Lien
appears
to
be
unapproachable
is
because
of
the
way
he
has
come
across
on
TV
.

He
should
do
more
to
reduce
tax
rates
on
wealth
and
income
,
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
those
cuts
yield
higher

Is
the
insurgency
in
its
last
throes
?

We
'll
ask
Bob
Woodward
that
question
next
.

Civil
aviation
and
air
force
transport
aircraft
are
responsible
for
transporting
large
equipment
and
backup
rescue
troops
.

One
concern
these
men
have
in
the
waterways
of
Iraq
is
the
threat
of
an
ambush
,
so
there
are
five
weapon
stations
on
the
special
operations
craft
.

and
they
're
going
to
be
very
well
respected
.

Bisheng
Bi
,
head
of
the
Jiangxi
Economic
and
Trade
Department
,
said
that
,
in
1997
,
there
were
429
recently
approved
foreign
investment
projects
with
contract
amounts
of
796
million
US
dollars
and
an
actually
utilized
foreign

of

Suddenly
an
angel
of
the
Lord
came
from
the
sky
,
and
there
was
a
huge
earthquake
.

These
terrorists
and
insurgents
will
use
brutal
tactics
because
they
're
trying
to
shake
the
will
of
the
United
States
of
America
.

The
measure
will
end

I
commented
on
the
words
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
and
I
told
him
:
Mr.
Fouad
Siniora
,
Prime
Minister
,
by
God
it
is
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
that
you
ask
us
,
you
give
us
two
options
,
either
to
hand
over
our
weapons
while
we
are
in
the
peak
of
battle
with
this
Israeli
enemy
,
or
threaten
us
that
you
'll

Some
analysts
reckon
that
the
next
quarter
's
figures
will
present
a
more
accurate
picture
of

a
marked

He
said
that
the
most
recently
convened
Seventh
Plenary
Session
of
the
Thirteenth
Central
Committee
of
the
Chinese
Communist
Party
reaffirmed
supporting
the
policies
of
reform
and
opening
up

and
upheld
the
policy
of
peaceful
foreign

acting
independently

keeping
the

``
On

Only

Then
Zechariah
,
John
's
father
,
was
filled
with
the
Holy
Spirit
and
told
the
people
a
message
from
God
:
``
Praise

the
Lord

Israel

I
know
I
am
right
to
think
like
this
about
all
of
you
because
you
are
so
close
to
my

There
are
,
unfortunately

plenty
of
answers
to
that
question

all

Mr.

was
bored

frequently
clashed
with

MCA

over
a

And
I
pray
that
the
Lord
will
forgive
me
for
this
:
When
my
master
goes
to
the
temple
of
Rimmon
to
worship
that
false
god
,
he
will
want
to
lean
on
me

The
bankruptcy
filing
,

government

charged
in
a

1.1

was
part
of
a

What
is
it
that
makes

so
popular

Laundered

served

Jordeena

the
story

The
best
thing
that
you
can
do
is
take
care
of
the
oil
here
at
the
source
of
pollution
,
where
it
's
concentrated
.

But
on
a
second
thought
,
I
felt
that
maybe
there
were
many
people
who
ought
to
feel
elated
.

The
45

year
-
old
Mr.

who
has
a
background
in

Trelleborg
plans
to
remain
the
dominant

with
stakes
of

less
than
50

Now
,
unless
I
've
lost
track
,
because
it
's
been
a
little
hard
to
keep
track
,
today
is
the
fifth
lead
change
in
Gallup
polling
after
Labor
Day
between
Gore
and
Bush
.

But
it
never
did
let
up
on
the
pressure
.

The
urgency
is
heightened
because
this
week
's
earthquake
--
while
major
and
followed
by
hundreds
of
aftershocks
--
did
n't
release
enough
pent
-up
energy
tension
along
the
faultlines
to
preclude
more
and
bigger
quakes
soon
.

But
we
ca
n't

that
John

was

And
if
you
look
at
the
of
Lebanon
you
see
that
uh
we
have
the
sea
and
we
have
Syria
on
most
of
our
borders
and
uh
in
the
south
we
have
Israel

And
they
said
absolutely

At
the

time
,
in

briefings

received
as
the
first
ranking
U.S.
official
to
go
to
Iraq
since
the
Baghdad
Pact
of
the
1950s
,
he
would
have
been
uniquely
aware

as
no

senior

in

,
of
the
brutal
character
of
Saddam

and
,
in
particular
,
the
sectarian
,
regional
,
tribal
,
and

politics
that
lay
behind
it

The

mainly
reflected
widespread
weakness

three

of

said

a

the

I
was
crazy

Facing
the
challenges
brought
by

,
each
country
should
continuously
implement
sound
economic
policies
and
deepen
structural
reform
so
as
to
enjoy
the
most
benefits
from
the
process
of
globalization
and
to
minimize
the
negative
effects
.

because
on
the
last
phone
call
they
came
in
and
told
us

The
dollar
began
yesterday
on
a
firm
note
in
Tokyo
,
closing
higher
in

While
they
do
n't
expect
the
Fed
to
move
right
away
,
they
say
the

is

So
I
escaped

The

did
not
specify
,
however
,
whether

I

they
may
want
the
deal
to
happen
,
but
they
do
n't
trust
the
intentions
of
the
other
side
.

If
it

neither

this

I

I
spent

Two
weeks
ago
,
viewers
of
several
NBC
daytime
consumer
segments
started
calling
a
900
number
for
advice
on
various
life
-
style
issues
.

I
mean
because
even
before
all
that
weird
stuff
you
know
I
've
been
talking
about
I
've
always
like
had
a
kind
of
weird
feeling
about
them
anyway
.

It
's
a
very
,
very
important
piece
of
equipment
.

It
became
certain
that
Turkey
's
accession
to
the
European

is
not
near
after
the
European
Commission
recommended
a
partial
freezing
of
the
discussions
between
Ankara
and
the
European
Union
.

He
said
that
"
I
believe
that
as
long
as
both
sides
make
joint
efforts
,
friendly
co-operative
relations
between
the
two
countries
will
definitely
continue
to
develop
on
the
principles
of
the
Sino
-
French
communique
on
the
establishment
of
diplomatic
relations
and
the
joint
communique
issued
on
January
12th
this
year
.
"

I
think
that
wherever
they
came
from
,
that
's
where
they
should
go
back
to
.

It
alone
is
n't
likely
to
stop

from
dumping

Yeah
,
for
many
,
many
years
at
a
high
level
,
than
a
President
of
a
country
trying
to
grapple
with
democracy
.

Once
an
environment
that
has
taken
shape
over
millions
of
years
is
destroyed
,
it
is
usually
beyond
man
's
ability
to
undo
the
damage
.

Lu
continues
:
"
Direct
election
of
the
president
has
'
put
the
candidate
on
a
pedestal
,
'
turning
the
attention
of
the
voters
to
the
individual
.

that

what
did
you

Because
a

gives

of

of
the
stock
at
a
stated
price
on
or
before
the

's
expiration
date
,
the
investor
is
protected
against
a
sudden
drop
in
the

's
price
.

Cool.

He
said
the

's

that

Grandma

was
close

30
years
old
when
the
Kuomintang
recovered
Taiwan

Besides
being
seen
as
a
blatant
handout
to

of
these
local

in

,

Recently
,
while
I
was
reading

I
had
this
feeling

we

it

But
I
want
you
to
be
wise
about
what
is
good
and
to
know
nothing
about
what
is
evil
.

But
even
with
that
many
fish
,
the
net
did
not
tear
.

You
should
keep
your
beliefs
about
these

a

In

Though
analysts
say
competition

probably
hold
down

many
expect

and
then
like

you

On

the

For

He
repeated
that
"
there
is
no
way
out
of
the
present
situation
other
than
through
a
national

which
all

which
takes
charge
of
setting
up

fair

non-politicized

There

Hungary

Finally

is
so
easy
to
talk
about

know

how

no

I
experienced

``
People
see
activity
in

,
and
the
next
thing
you
know
,
you
've
got
a
haunting

he
says
.

``
There
will
be
a
big
influx
of

Paul
and
those
with
him
went

not
allow
them
to
tell
the

The

And
through
him

Joab

Investors
pulled
back
from
bond
funds
in
September
,
too
.

and
I
was
just
curious
if
you
'd
had
that
same
problem
.

oh
yeah

Since
movies
were
regarded
merely
as
entertainment
,
studio
bosses
were
n't
willing
to
invest
in
films
on
these
sort
of
topics
,
for
they
did
n't
think
that
audiences
would
come
to
see
them
.

Gill

,
a

Reassuring

a
way
I
would
think
.

Traders
and
analysts
said
the
divergence
between
the
stock
and
bond
markets
is
a
sign
of
growing
unease
about
the
economic
outlook
.

For
48
hours
,
no
one
had
any
idea
precisely
how
much
his
securities
were
worth
.

Orkem
declined
to
give
details
of

,
saying
only

According

is

pinching

,
and
"
makes

Our
attempt
,
as
conservatives
,
to
stand
up
against
issues
such
as
these
must
not
be
satisfied
with
only
the
fatwas
of
important
scholars

but
we
must
employ
other
means
.

``
It

I
see

she
applies

you
're
not
going
that
far
?

Or
perhaps
that
is
a
fitting
symbol
for

nothing

real
value

What
I

that
when

give
it

fully

tobacco
company
,
known
for
making
brown

tobacco
cigarettes
such
as
Gauloises
and
Gitanes

is
branching
out.

She
needs
a
strong
man

is
fully
focused
on

as
well
as
capable
of
,
making
the
Chinese
nation
prosperous
and
strong
,
and
making
the
Chinese
people
wealthy
and
happy
;
she
neither
needs
nor
accepts
those
shameless
opportunists
and
hoodlum
politicians
who
betray
and
sacrifice
the
political
and
economic
interests
of
the
entire
nation
and
all
of
the
people
for
themselves
,
their
own
family
clan
,
and
their
own
small
clique
and
small
social
stratum
,
for
the
sake
of
their
own
gratitude
or
resentment
,
prestige
,
and
interests
,
leaving
the
Chinese
nation
and
the
Chinese
people
to
suffer
loss
,
disaster
,
and
humiliation
.

But
that
means
paying
the
horse

As

The
Senate

is
rapidly
disintegrating

This

support
whatever

without

about

on

The
United

is
also
a
country
of
immigrants

with
a
pluralistic
culture

and
a
very
complex
demographic
composition
;
hence
the
task
of
safeguarding
the
country
's
internal
security
is
certainly
an
arduous
one
,
and
it
can
be
imagined
that
a
police
force
with
advanced
and
powerful
equipment
is
needed
.

Uh
if
we
had
to
pick
a
single
thing
to
underscore
how
completely
life
has
changed
in
this
country
since
nine

it
might
be
the
fact
that
there
are
now
arguments
serious

against

But
with

Mr.

the
regulatory
thicket
that
he
had
helped
cut
back

They
do
n't
know
when
to
expect
him
back

and
have
been
told
he
faces
lots
of
questions

In

they
're
both
part
of
the
military
blueprint

In

depletion
he
has
extensively
studied
the
related
topic
of
global

,
a
theory
that
mankind
's
generation
of
carbon
dioxide
through
increased
combustion
of
fossil
fuels
is
creating
a
``
greenhouse

''
that
will
work
important

Yesterday

conference
agreement
is
the
second
major
bill
to
emerge
from

this
week
,
as
appropriators
approved
a
fiscal
1990
transportation
bill
late
Monday
that
includes
a
sweeping
ban
on
smoking
on
most
domestic
airline
flights

I
think
so
too
.

Mr.
Whitten
's
package
appears
to
accomplish
this
purpose
,
but
the
state
faces
more
resistance
in
its
bid
for
an
extended
waiver
on
having
to
put
up
any
matching
funds
on
repairs
completed
in
the
next
six

Barak
did
n't
just
do
some
one
thing
which
is
very
cynical
,
he
also
did
something
which
is
not

clever
politically

there
is
a
,
built

majority
in
the
Knesset

if
there
are

how
can
he
manage
the

How
to
Help

Wanpeng
Shi
said
that
in
order
to
achieve
a
major
breakthrough
in
the
reform
and
solution
of
problems
in
the
textile
industry
,
the
State
Council
and
relevant
departments
have
successively
determined
a
series
of
powerful
policies
and
measures
.

But
that
rule
is
being
virtually
overlooked
by
Wall
Street
,
which
is
concentrating
on
coping
with
the
deduction
issue
.

It
's
an
``
absolute
necessity
''

Avner
Arbel
,

was
during

of
his
enduring
relationships
with
a
variety
of
U.S.

agencies
.

Despite
Prince
Charles
'
ugly
divorce
with
Princess
Diana
,
the
affection
between
father

is
now
palpable

enviable
.

Furthermore
,
with
strengthened
confidence
in
investors
and
consumers
,
an
increase
in
overseas
remittance
and
public
expenditures
,
and
a
rising
employment
rate
that
boosted
total
wages
,
domestic
demand
had
strengthened
in
the
countries
of
this
region
,
which
had
in
turn
witnessed
further
economic
growth
.

The
Lord
will
do
this
because
the
people
made
him
angry

they
built

Since

There

the

kill

to
a
loss
of
alignment
among

hence
allowing

But
then
a

I

roughly
the
reason

This

he
joked

Is
he

So

This

Ms.

Joseph

Judas

Right.

Brokers
clutching
thick

stand
in

He
sent
me
to
tell

to
tell

Surely
there
is
someone
in
your
group
wise
enough
to
judge
a
complaint
between
two
believers
.

Yes
,
and
hates
him
as
much
as
everyone
else
does
.

There
will
never
be

again

In

if

not
quiet
down

That

never

right
until

,
the
Yugoslav

so
the

we

that

the
most
dominant

expressing

opinions
,
ranging
from
Asahi

to

,
etc
,
well
,
recently
,
even
Yomiuri

,
which
originally
expressed
support
for
Koizumi

,
has
started
to
change

As

the

Is
there
a
danger
that
if
lawsuits
like
this
succeed
that
basically
any
time
a
uh
public
official
uh
acts
in
a
particular

does
n't

if
something
horrible
happens
later
that

will
be
held

why
we
never
give

No

it
followed
an
announcement
that
the

channel
of
regular
contact
with
the
Palestinians

But
I
really
have
a
problem
with

.

Even
in
an
abnormal
circumstance
such
as

relief

there
seems

the

Mr.
Dorfman
provides
confirming
evidence
of
this

when

reports
that
your

accumulated
only

112,383
by

selecting
four

Only
then
did
he
repent

and
he
thought
of
how
worthy
Dingxiang

And
the

already

in

there
is

who
is
stopping

secret
power

At

was
not

Jesus

You
asked
for

did
not

on
well
together

constant

they
finally
divorced

ignored

These
are
the
biggest
issues
faced
by
the
new

are
mad
as

about

anti-intellectualism
and
they
are
n't
going
to
take
it
anymore
,
at

not
without
trying
a
few
really
neat
ideas
first
.

The
people
who
keep
harping
about
``

''
typically
have
no
knowlege
of
how
expensive
it
is
to
both
run
it

maintain
it

Then
,
the

Despite
his
reluctance
to
take
the
latter
step
,
the
judge
indicated
he
would
move
quickly
after
hearing

this

bitter
dispute

At
times
,
the

that

have
reached
an
impasse
,
and
at

times
he
says
that
the

has
hope
in
,
uh
,
reaching
a
solution
for
this
government

They
realized
the
fact
that

this

While

many

It

A

you

an

it
as

I

being

non

That
is
the
way

come

Additionally
,
two
regiments
,
together
with
local
armed
forces
in
places
such
as
Pingding

Liaoxian

Yushe

carried
out
sabotage

do
n't

the

endorsed

Well
I
happen
to
think
that
the
way
Karl

George

trying

is
about
domestic
security

I
believe
Mr.
Kageyama
left
out
one
major
aspect
of
Japanese
culture
that
permeated
his
piece
:
the
belief
in
the
superiority
of
Japanese
culture
and
behavior
vs.
others
.

aw
is
n't
that
good
.

This
year
,
China
's
macro-economic
policy
will
maintain
continuity
,
stability
and
require
flexibility
.

But
after
Silas
and
Timothy
came
from
Macedonia
,
Paul
spent
all
his
time
telling
God
's
message
to
the
Jews
,
trying
to
convince
them
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
.

Jesus
left
the
city
and
went
to
the
Mount
of
Olives
.

Right.

I
have
given
her
time
to
change
her
heart
and
turn
away
from
her
sin
,
but
she
does
not
want
to
change
.

He
expressed
that
"
after
the
independence
of
Kyrgyzstan
,
there
has
been
a
larger
increase
in
the
volume
of
trade
between
the
two
countries
,
mainly
in
the
border
regions
.

Let
's
start
with
the
premise
that
increased
population
and
new
jobs
means
more
people
who
need
a
place
to
live
.

John
criticized
Herod
the
ruler
for
what
he
had
done
with
Herodias
,
the
wife
of
Herod
's
brother
,
as
well
as
for
all
the
other
bad
things
he
had
done
.

She
's
on
retreat

But
knowledge
is
intangible
.

But
this
part
is
critically
important
.

Sometimes
when
it
comes
too
easy
you
can
get
soft
but
I
liked
the
way
they
responded
.

According
to
Japanese
media
reports
on
December
9
,
apart
from
expressing
the
joys
of
rearing
her
daughter
,
Masako
also
recalled
her
experience
of
visiting
some
children
's
facilities
.

The
report
laid
the
blame
on
speculators
,
who
it
said
had
pushed
land
prices
up
ninefold
.

But
he
was
also
diagnosed
with
bipolar
disorder
.

That
and
other
fancy
gizmos
may
cost
thousands
,
but
simple
voice
-
activated
tape
recorders
sell
for
as
little
as
$
70
at
electronics
stores
like
Radio
Shack
.

For
people
who
can
ride
out
market
waves
through
good
times
and
bad
,
stocks
have
been
rewarding
long
-
term
investments
.

People
stumble
because
they
do
n't
obey
what
God
says
.

Second
,
it
explains
why
voters
hold
Congress
in
disdain
but
generally
love
their
own
congressional
representatives
:
Any
individual
legislator
's
constituents
appreciate
the
specific
benefits
that
the
legislator
wins
for
them
but
not
the
overall
cost
associated
with
every
other
legislator
doing
likewise
for
his
own
constituency
.

In
order
to
improve
the
air
quality
in
all
Europe

cities
,
the
European
Union
--
having
put
the
Euro
4
emission
standards
into
effect
on
January
1
,
2005
--
has
now
drafted
the
stricter
Euro
5
and
Euro
6
Emission
Standards
.

If

The
initial
assessment
by
the
police
is
that
the
accident
was
caused
by
a
brake
malfunction
and
a
burst
rear
-
right
tire
.

God
I
guess
it
's
happening

``
The
only
way
to

up

While

amount

increasing

[qqtlbos]
In
the
contribution
by
daysafter
I
am
not
happy
,
it
was
mentioned
:

Here
on
earth
we
do
n't
have
a
city
that
lasts
forever
.

As
for
the
nuclear
program
which
the
Gulf
Cooperation
Council
has
approved
,
I
believe
that
among
the
most
important
reasons
on
which
the
Council
agreed
in
this
framework
is
to
enter
in
this
important
industry
,
the
importance
of
which
not
only
includes
a
military
aspect
,
but
also
a
peaceful
aspect
,
in
order
to
establish
an
industry
subject
to
strict
controls
that
can
not
be
violated
,
in
order
to
guarantee
its
peaceful
direction
.

But
creditors
are
free
to
press
for
court
approval
of
their
own
plan
,
or
the
court
could
ignore
both
sides
and
draw
its
own
.

This
is
like
the
words
written
in
the
book
of
Isaiah
the
prophet
:
``
There
is
someone
shouting
in
the
desert
:
'
Prepare
the
way
for
the
Lord
.

It
is
noticed
that
the
officials
in
Hezbollah
prevent
any
stranger
from
entering
the
places
of
the
strikes
or
trying
to
get
in
touch
or
talk
with
some
of
the
strikers
for
fear
of
revealing
these
secrets
.

It
is
partly
for
this
reason
that
the
exchange
last
week
began
trading
in
its
own
stock
``
basket
''
product
that
allows
big
investors
to
buy
or
sell
all
500
stocks
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
index
in
a
single
trade
.

If
foreign
enterprises
still
lack
the
conditions
to
apply
these
methods
,
they
should
not
rush
blindly
to
enter
the
New
York
market
,
lest
they
be
left
out
in
the
cold
.

like

worry
that

Their
main
claim
to

is
...
nothing

actually

that
is
precisely
why
their

typifies
the
experiences
of
so
many
.

This
cuts
down
greatly
on
labor
,
Mr.
Buchner
said
.

Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ariel
Sharon
and
Palestinian
Prime
Minister
Mahmoud
Abbas
have
postponed
Wednesday
's
planned
meeting
on
the
Mideast

The
decision
was
announced
following
an

That
's
what

But
so
far

Today

and
if
we
determine
that
state
charges
are
more
appropriate
uh
then
we
will
ask
the
city
attorney
to
defer
to
the
district
attorney
's
office

And
we
still
have
the
promise
that
God
gave

In

that

But
in

,
small

generally
opposes
an

,
fearing
the

7.8

As
a
result
,
says
Mr.
Geiger
,
lawyers
think
twice
before
appealing
a
judge
's
ruling
,
are
reluctant
to
mount
,
or
even
support
,
challenges
against
him
for
re-election
and
are
usually
loath
to
file
complaints
that
might
impugn
a
judge

integrity

a

particularly
I
think
for

Their
dereliction
was
assured

in

by

what

there
's

that

be
a

in

that

Prepare

why

This

If

heard

Urban
infrastructure
construction
which
restricted
the
attraction
of
foreign
capital
is
now
thought
highly
of
by
foreign
businesses
and
following
resource
development
is
becoming
a
new
field
of
focused
use
of
foreign
capital
in
Qinghai
.

The

were
executing
municipal
bond
,

other

through
a

Tucker

,
which
is
also
owned
by
John
Hancock

is
based
in

In
the
past
five
years
land
developers
have
totally
invested
4
billion
HK
dollars
for
use
in
the
construction
of
such
infrastructure
as
power
plants
,
main
roads
in
the
region
and
an
underground
pipe
network
in
the

,
landscaping
,
post
and
telecommunication
,
etc.

Nowadays
the
ancient
Beijing

Hangzhou
Grand

not
only
plays
an
important
role
in
north

south
transportation
,
but
has
also
brought
about
a
thriving
industry
corridor
,
resulting
in
the
formation
of

Economic
Belt

Well
,
that
's
one
of

that

Hezekiah
began
to
rule
during
the
third
year
that
Hoshea
son
of
Elah
was
king
of
Israel
.

This
gives
us
nothing
but
confusions
and
concerns
.

If
the
market
surges
,
holders
can
make
that
much
more
profit
;
the
leverage
effectively
acts
as
an
interest

free
margin
account
for

.

They
worshiped
worthless

and
this
made

His

Nabih
Berri

explained
this

said
,
the

does
not
depend
on
the

,
or
changing
the
prime
minister
,
or
a
new
confidence
.

A
month
ago
,
when
Beatrice
first
filed
to
sell
debt
,
the
company
had
planned
to
offer
$
200
million
of
its
senior
subordinated
reset
notes
at
a
yield
of
12
3/4
%
.

It
can
you
know
.

I
do
n't
know
if
he
was
in
his
body
or
away
from
his
body
,
but
he
heard
things
that
he
is
not
able
to
explain
.

In
addition
,
Putin
attended
the
ribbon
-
cutting
ceremony
.

But
he
reiterated
the
bank
's
position
that
it
is
comfortable
with
the
current
level
of
$
2.6
billion
,
covering
about
30
%
of
the
$
8.9
billion
of
such
loans
outstanding
.

He
got
some
support
today
as
he
attended
a
summit
of
European
Union
leaders
in
France
.

So
send
the
people
away
.

Someone
who
is
weak
,
like
a
stem
of
grass
blowing
in

?

However
,
what
I
like
is

They
'll

He
may
win

D.C.
,
but
he
is
n't
going

Tennessee
!

because
I
have
a
test
on
it

and
my
guess
is
John
Bolton
would
have
been
confirmed
.

After
completing
installation
of
the
jackets
on
``
one

''
of
the
freeway
last
year
,
the
state
DOT
had
sent
the
project
over
to
its
Sacramento
engineers
to
draw
up
a
final

.

So
how
are
they
getting
back
?

Al

a

But
Samuel

He
said

and
I
'm

my

just
come
up

--oh.--
he

You
have
heard
about
my
past
life
in
the
Jewish
religion
.

Yet
some
people
are
advancing
a
chilling
casuistry
:
that
what
we
are
seeing
is
somehow
the
understandable
result
of
the
historical
sins
committed
by
the
Turks
in

16th

The

was
scheduled
earlier
,
but
it
was
postponed
after
the
closure
of

at
the

,
as
a

of

The
resulting
haunted

tends
to
reward
followership

not

it
creates
guilt
about

the

they
have

According
to
the
analysis
of
the
National
Statistical
Bureau
,
the
extremely
favorable
conditions
for
China
's
economic
development
mainly
comprise
of
two
aspects
:
the
first
being
the
sustained
growth
of
the
world
economy
and
international
trade
,
which
indicates
the
steady
expansion
of
international
market
demands

a
comparatively
favorable
international
environment

If
the

will
be

In

some
South

Well
,
%um.
Because
he
kicks
so
much
,
you
know
,
it
's
really
annoying
.

It
's
true
that
faced
with
such
a
great
disaster
,
it
's
more
crucial
to
repair
damaged
roads
.

The
Zhejiang
Provincial
Bureau
of
Quality
and
Technical
Supervision
recently
conducted
a
random
inspection
of
the
quality
of
plastic

boards

There
was
a
women

and
the

held
a

but
it
was
out

reach

``
All

on
overtime
salaries

he
said
.

But
U.S.
officials
say
they
are
n't
satisfied
these
incidents
constitute
terrorism
because
they
may
be
offshoots
of
the
intifadah
,
the
Palestinian
rebellion
in
the
occupied
territories
,
which
the
U.S.
does
n't
classify
as
terrorism

Let
's
take
a
look
at
something
that
Jose

said
here
last
night

The
misguided
idea
that
"
what
is
new
is
better
"
also
has
been
a
problem
in
Taiwan

More
clashes
erupted
there
today

What
do
they
have
that
sets
them
apart
?

Through
the
prophets
he
said
that
his
Christ
would
suffer
and
die
.

Unlike
previous
attacks
,
this
one
began
without
warning
and
early
enough
that
people
were
still

The
response
on
the
Internet
has
been
a
dispute
rarely
seen
in
the
forums
.

I
can
hardly
figure
it
out.

I
mean
I
'm
just
saying
this
so
easily

It
may
be
that
the
pursuit
of
economic
and
trade
relations
is
the
only
way
to
get
Taiwan
and
mainland
China
onto
the
path
toward
a
resolution
of
the
cross-strait
stalemate
.

In
recent
years
,
foreign
businessmen
have
been
quite
actively
investing
in
Guangxi
,
manufacturing
projects
and
large
backbone

have
increased
,
and
such
large
companies
with
abundance
resources
as
Japan
's
Itochu
Corporation
,
Korea
's
Daewoo
Corporation
,
Hong
Kong
's
Changjiang
Industry

,
etc.
have
all
invested
in
Guangxi
one

Those
activities
generated

During
the
time
when
Herod
ruled
Judea
,
there
was
a
priest
named
Zechariah
.

Jesus
answered
,
``
Go

The
economy
is
taking

But
the
music
has
its
charm
,
and
Mr.
Glass
has
constructed
his
solo
program
around
a
move
from
the
simple
to
the
relatively
complex
.

So
Jesus
said
to
the
Jews
who
believed
in
him
,
``
If
you
continue
to
accept
and
obey
my

,
you

It

also
vague
,
meaning
there
was
no
way
to
carry
out
effective

to

standards
,
so
the
notice
of
rejection
of

was
not

If
I

``

the
near

unanimous
answer
would
be

Jesus

went

Well
,
to
Japanese
people
,
what
they
are
more
concerned
with
is
,
for
example
,
how
my
economy
is
developing
,
how
my
life
will
be
,
whether
the
national
interests
will
be
damaged

whether

But
they
did
not

it

That
's
a
fact

When
acquired
in
May
1988
by
British
retailer
Marks

Spencer
PLC
,

about

41.8

In
fact
,
it
's
precisely
because
the
price
of
driving
a
fake
military
vehicle
is
too
small
.

Japan
remains
the
biggest
trade
partner
,
while
the
US
and
Hong

are
second
and
third

You
are
absolutely
wrong
,
however
,
in
opining
that
this
position
is
some
kind
of
``
flip
-
flop
,
''
something
newly
arrived
at
as
a
result
of
reading
the
opinion
polls
.

I
write
this
letter
knowing
that
you
will
do
what
I
ask
,
and
even
more
than
I
ask
.

I
want
them
to
see
my
glory
--
the
glory
you
gave
me
because
you
loved
me
before
the
world
was
made
.

At
the
very
beginning
,
it
was
encouraged
by
Israel
because
they
thought
it
was
a
counter
weight
to
Palestinian
nationalism
which
is
,
of
course
,
a
secular
movement
.

As
Ko
Chen-en
,
dean
of
the
College
of
Management
at
National
Taiwan
University
,
puts
it
:
"
You
merely
have
to
ask
how
many
Nobel
Prize
winners
Taiwan
has
-
not
many
-
and
you
know
its
real
ability
to
follow
the
US
economic
model
.
"

I
mean
I
think
that
they
should
have
seen
that
I
'm
sure
you
know
maybe
this
was
nobody
's
fault
maybe
it
was
both
of
our
faults

It
is
the

Now
many
of
the
fish
he
saw
are
in
danger
because
pollutants
could
sink
and
kill
the
algae
on
which
underwater
life
depends
,
but
late
today
,
the
news
was
encouraging
--
that
wind
and

were
carrying
most
of
the
spill
away
from

.

In
other
words
,
we
need
to
draw

the
strengths
of
both
Eastern
and
Western
culture
,
to
show
that

values
are
also

values

is

William

that

it

,
people
of

,
let
's
go
home

let
David

While
David
was
king
,
there
was
a
famine
that
continued
for
three
years
.

Earlier
this
year
,
Penney
abandoned
another
home
shopping
venture
,
Telaction
Corp.
,
after
investing
$
106
million
in
it
.

He
took
all
the
skilled
workers
and
craftsmen
.

But
he
was
not
like
his
father
and
mother
,
because
he
removed
the
pillar
that
his
father
had
made
for
worshiping
Baal
.

But
if
you
suffer
for
doing
good
and
you
are

this

We
are

God
does

You
know
I
would
recommend
to
anybody
going
on
a
medicine
that
they
learn
of
the
side
effects
first
so
that
they
can
combat
them
because
nothing
's
worse
than
finding
success
with
a
medicine
and
then
gaining
a

of
weight

Of

,
I
do
n't
have
any
objections
against
this
downward

There
was
also
one

moment
there
when
you
heard
a

asking
about

We
speak
for
Christ
when
we
beg
you
to
be
at

Also
adding
complexity
to
things
is
the
American
and
British
rejection
of
the
Hamas
Movement
,
i.e.
there
was
a
contradiction
in
supporting
,
for
example
,
the

in
Lebanon

not
recognizing
a

So
what
should
I
do
?

I
feel
it
necessary
to
say
here
since
it
explains
in
part
the
trend
of
the
modest
work
which
I
later
accomplished
that
the
two
basic
sentiments
of
my
childhood
which
stayed
with
me
well
into
adolescence
,
are
those
of
a
profound
eroticism
,
at
first
sublimated
in
a
great
religious
faith
,
and
a
permanent
consciousness
of
death
.

When
the
non-Jewish

heard

they
were
happy

Meddling

Could
it
be

of

full

feeling
proud
reminiscing
her

Lee
said
that
the
purpose
of
his
whirlwind
visit
was
only
to
get
a
first
-
hand
feel
for
the
new
administration
.

and
then
that
's
it

The
suspension
of
foreign
loans
has
weakened
the
buying
power
of
China
's
national
trading
companies
,
which
are
among
the
country
's
biggest
importers
.

A
great
deal
of
effort
has
been
devoted
to
opening
new
museums
in
Taiwan
in
recent
years
.

The
combination
of
solid
loan
growth
with
tight
expense
control
gave
Wells
Fargo
a
1.25
%
return
on
average
assets
for
the
quarter
,
about
40
%
higher
than
Security
Pacific
's
and
a
profit
ratio
matched
by
only
two
or
three
other
major
banks
in
the
U.S.
.

But
the
work
that
each
person
does
will
be
clearly
seen
,
because
the
Day
will
make
it
plain
.

So
it
's
kind
of
a
step
up
for
me
.

I
know
.

He
did
n't
write
that
to
the
Owens
family
.

So
if
he
was
going
to
visit
her
he
would
you
know
occasionally
stop
in
here
on
his
way
home
.

He
was
responsible
for
taking
care
of
all
her
money
.

and
that
is
the
proper
role
of
religion
in
uh
the
politics
of
the

When
a
reporter
asked
whether
the
fact
that
now
a
large
number
of
Chinese
citizens
overstay
short
-
term
visas
after
entering
Russia
will
become
a
factor
in
tense
relations
between
China
and
Russia
and
how
this
problem
should
be
solved
,
Zemin
Jiang
expressed
that
with
the
continuous
development
of
friendly
,
neighborly
relations
between
China
and
Russia
in
recent
years
,
the
two
countries
are
no
longer
isolated
from
each
other
,
and
relations
between
them
have
expanded
,
with
rapidly
increasing
staff
contacts
.

Exxon
Mobil
maintains
it
does
take
the
issue
seriously
and
it
is
being
targeted
unfairly
zblen
ron
also
engaging
in
a
blame
game
.

And
we
will
know
the
answer
.

The
fares
are

named
Hugo
,
Compassion
and
Virgin
Islands
Aid
.

They
told
me
that
you
continue
to
follow
the
way
of
truth
.

But
they
have
to
attract
good
senior
bankers
who
can
bring
in
the
business
from
day
one
.

Be

He
has
heard
the
President

the
Vice

accuse
uh
people
who
disagree
with
his
war
policy
like
Paul
Hackett

My
brothers
and
sisters
,
I
beg
you
to
listen
patiently
to
what
I
have
said
.

The
sunroom
at
Kim
Bondy
's
house
in
New
Orleans
sure
could
use
a
little
sun
.

Because
it
operates
on

earlier
than

They
fought
in
a

of

And
the
reporters
were
n't
ready

Then
I
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
.

With
Taiwan
for
R&D
and
Zhuhai
as
the
manufacturing
base
,
Macau
can
provide
a
window
to
foreign
trade
,
through
which
companies
can
increase
their
exports
to
the
EU
.
"

here
's
some
of
what
we
've
seen
from
New
Orleans
police
since
hurricane
Katrina
.

The
Kailuan
Mine
Bureau
has
lost
only
seven
out
of
10,000
of
its
mine
workers
,
which
is
a
miracle
of
disaster
preparedness
.

Was
the
alternative
to
leave
Saddam
Hussein
in
power
uh
continuing
to
threaten
his
neighbors
continuing
with
his
uh
windfall
profits
from
the
oil
for
food
scandal
continuing
to
repress
uh
his
people
and
build
mass
graves
uh
continuing
to
uh
use
those
oil
for
food
profits
to
again
build
the
infrastructure
for
his
weapons
of
mass
destruction
?

Mr.
Ritterman
said
that
in
the
next
six
months
he
will
take
$
50
million
from
the
Soap
Opera
Digest
sale
to
acquire
new
magazines
.

He
ate
the
honey
and
began
to
feel
much
better
.

They
told
you
,
``
In
the
last
times
there
will
be
people
who
laugh
at
God
and
do
only
what
they

do

are

This
is
my
inserted
comment
The
problem
my
Chinese
classmates
easily
fall
into
is
,
let
's
say
in
the
context
of
China
,
which
issue
is
very
important
,
which
issue
does
my
article
seek
to
resolve
,
all
right
,
maybe
I
can
get
it
into
China
Quarterly
,
it
could
go
into
that
kind
of
publication
.

And
to
the
uninitiated
,
some
of
the
firm
's
approaches
may
seem
chillingly
manipulative
.

He
concedes
:
``
This
is
the
most
difficult
market
that
I
've
been
involved
in
.
''

I
persecuted
the
people
who
followed
the
Way
.

Are
there
any
kind
of
environmental
concerns
?

And
I
want
to
,

I
did
n't
hear
about
it
,
explains
this
man
,
because
we
did
n't
have
electricity
.

They
are
now
eating
and
drinking
with
him
.

In
Britain
,
those
interests
include
the
Beefeater
steakhouse
chain
and
joint
ownership
with
PepsiCo
Inc.
of
the
country
's
Pizza
Hut
chain
.

Saddam
might
be
to
the
Iranians
the
devil
himself
,
but
do
they
know
that
they
turned
him
,
in
the
eyes
of
Arabs
and
Sunnis
,
into
a
virtuous
saint
?

On
the
streets
on
the
second
day
of
the
revolution
,
the
people
of

are
savoring
their
victory
,
swept
up
by
the
sudden
death
of
their
dictatorship
.

Then
I
saw
another
angel
flying
high
in
the
air
.

At
5:40
p.m.
,
scheduled
game
time
having
passed
,
some

chanted
``

If
there
are
any

that

be
less
inclined

Did
Mr.

gain

if

how
?

The
big
question
is
whether

have
the
strength

the
political
support
in

you
to
listen

what

said

the
readiness
of

By
doing

they
will

We
are

British

a

to

rarely

made
it

In

,
regarding

that

told

it

Thornburgh
announced
his
plan
.

I
think
a
number
of
things
have
happened
;

Mr.
Allen
,
appointed
by
President
Reagan
,
grew
understandably
tired
of
dealing
with
the
guerrilla
tactics
of
his
enemies
.

A
successful
low
-
crime
mall
in
a
high
-
crime
area
violates
the
more
typical
inner
-
city
pattern
,
in
which
commercial
areas
are
taken
over
by
unruly
youth
,
gangs
,
and
the
criminal
element
,
with
an
erosion
of
the
customer
base
,
development
capital
,
and
insurability
.

Islamist
leaders
have
also
accused
security
forces
of
preventing
voters
from
entering
polling
stations
in
areas
where
the
opposition
is
strong
.

The
men
can
defeat
immunities
that
states
often
assert
in
court
by
showing
that
officials
knew
or
should
have
known
that
design
of
the
structure
was
defective
and
that
they
failed
to
make
reasonable
changes
.

Industrial
output
surged
21
%
in
1988
,
while
inflation
peaked
last
February
at
nearly
30
%
.

The
House
joined
the
Senate
in
making
federal
reparations
for
Japanese
-
Americans
held
in
World
War
II
internment
camps
a
legal
entitlement
requiring
the
Treasury
Department
to
meet
expedited
payments
of
an
estimated
$
1.25
billion
during
the
next
several
years
.

It
all
got
quite
heated
.

The
struggle
for
power
in
a
post-Saddam
Iraq
has
begun
.

Because
if
you
're
not
coming
anyways
then
Right.
I
do
n't
have
to
fly
with
you
so
I
could
just
come
that
Friday
.

We
have
no

Yes
,
everything
is
made
clear
by
the
light

disorienting
collision
between

material
world
and

but
the
magnitude
of
destruction
makes
rebuilding
very
difficult
.

Perhaps
the
biggest
hurdle
owners
face
is
convincing
newcomers
that
this
is
a
reputable

What
's

So
they
're
coming
for
three
weeks

earlier

well
the
thing
is
,
**Dougo
's**
kind
of
annoying
me
a
little
bit
.

Every
workday
at
11
a.m.
,
40
-
year
-
old
Mike
Sinyard
dons
cycling
clothes
,
hops
on
a
bike
he
keeps
at
his
Morgan
Hill
,
Calif.
,
office
and
sets
out
to
cover
a
distance
most
people
would
travel
only
by
car
.

But
at
the
end
of
lunch
,
Eve
just
told
her
to
go
home
.

The
women
should
keep
quiet
in
these
church
meetings
.

Two
days
later
there
was
a
wedding
in
the
town
of
Cana
in
Galilee
,
and
Jesus
'
mother
was
there
.

All
three
major
creditors
--
the
IRS
,
Minpeco
and
Manufacturers
Hanover
--
voted
against
and
effectively
doomed
a
reorganization
plan
proposed
by
Mr.
Hunt
.

The
most
urgent
time
was
still
the
1990s
.

Yes
indeed
,
it
was
a
political
idea
put
forward
in
the
writings
of
the
and
another
very
famous
french
political
observer
Alexis
de
Tocqueville
who
visited
America
and
wrote
an
amazingly
good
book
about
American
democracy
,
said
exactly
that
,
that
America
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
single
country
in
the
world
who
has
managed
to
apply
the
separation
of
powers
between
the
judiciary
,
the
executive
,
and
the
legislative
in
a
better
way
than
any
other
country
.

But
the
FDA
in
a
1985
letter
to
the
United
Egg
Producers
said
that
there
was
``
little
likelihood
''
of
a
health
problem
as
long
as
instructions
were
followed
.

However
,
he
said
he
planned
to
spend
the
weekend
making
calls
to
gather
additional
support
.

Right

Led
by
a
near
-
perfect
performance
by
Alan
Wilder
as
Max
,
the
father
,
the
play
is
at
once
an
appalling
and
hilarious
dissection
of
a
family
's
rage
,
bitterness
,
fear
and
isolation
.

75
%
of
Iraqi
oil
to
foreign
companies
and
25
%
to
Iraqis
.

The
flight
is
also
reported
to
be
the
first
to
carry
an
Iraqi
official
out
of
Baghdad
since
the
United
Nations
placed
sanctions
on
Iraq
10
years
ago
.

But
it
could
also
accelerate
``
marketization
''
by
reinforcing
industrial
accountability
,
breaking
up
state
monopolies
,
giving
managers
a
stake
in
solutions
,
and
ensuring
that
modernization
is
not
reversible
for
failure
to
address
environmental
effects
.

The
negotiations
carried
out
thorough
discussions
on
some
principle
and
detailed
issues
and
some
understanding
was
reached
.

Well
um
it
really
was
good
.

Arthritis

They
are
one
of

The
followers
asked
Jesus
,
``
Where

this
be

Lord
?
''

However
,
that
does
n't
mean
they
can
benefit
from
the

.

and
then
I
also
have
the

here
in
Detroit

But
in
the
stock
and
real

markets
,
activity
remains
spotty
even
though
prices
have
regained
much
of
their
lost
ground
.

Then
someone
told
Solomon
,
``
Adonijah

Our

more
honorable

you
talking
about
it
and
describing
it
using
the
worst

as
if
you
are
talking
about
the
societies
of
the
West
.

That
's
the
problem

I

Teams

Here
's
what
the
President
and
the
Vice
President
have
been
saying
on
the
stump
at

events

I
thought
that
was
pretty
intelligent

you
know
,
it
's
not
as
if
,

The
judge
handling
the
case
in
state
Supreme
Court
,
a
trial
court
,
had
tossed
out
the
jury
verdicts
,
ruling
that
the
matter
should
have
been
handled
under
federal
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Administration
rules
.

``
Then
the
godly
people
will
answer
,
'
Lord
,
when
did
we
see
you
hungry
and
give
you
food
?

Then
all
the
churches
will
see
that
I
am
the
one
who
knows
what
people
feel
and
think
.

This
is
about
the

On

research

at

recently
forecasted

from

The

surrounded

attacked

And
there
was
speculation
yesterday
that
Fidelity

might

follow
the

of

and
other
institutions
in
cutting

to

firms
that
do
program
trading
.

The
Lord
saw
that
all
the
Israelites
,
both
slaves
and
free
men
,
had
many
troubles
.

He
says
that
to
meet
the
challenge

meet
the
goal
,
Shanghai
will
promote
a
new
round
of

restructuring
,
boldly
implement

and
actively
exploit

says

Already

many
of

But
now
that
Iran
and
its
agents
have
executed
him
in
this
horrible
way
,
he
has
entered
history
by
its
widest
doors
,
after
he
had
exited
history
years
ago
.

Furthermore
,
his
actions
imply
that
it
is
too
damaging
or
costly
for
society
to
provide
jobs
through
power
-
plant
construction
,
coal
mining
or
to
build
roads
for
public
safety
because
of
the
adverse
impact
on
the
environment
,
but
it
is
just
fine
and
dandy
for
him
to
transform
a
mountain
high
in
the
Wasatch
Range
into
a
ski
resort
.

Commercial

As
I
remember
,
when
an
earthquake
struck
Taiwan
Province
,
I
noticed
on
TV
that
while
many
residential
buildings
were
already
tilted
,
they
just
did
not
collapse
,
which
created
opportunities
for
people
to
survive
.

They
wanted
the
other
men
to
think
that
they
were
throwing
more
anchors
from
the
front
of
the
ship
.

the
Holiday
Inn
man
that
sounded
yucky
%um
area
was
ninety
nine
dollars
for
a
double
,
without
a
continental
breakfast
,
and
a
hundred
and
fourteen
dollars
with
the
continental
breakfast
,

but
do
you
think
that
's
even
possible
the
idea
of
a
fusion
ticket
between
uh
Biden
and
McCain
?

But
because
there
is
a
little
discord
in
Saudi
society
,
it
certainly
does
not
represent
the
whole
and
it
does
not
represent
the
opposing
public
opinion
.

I
expected
it
in
a
country
we
love
,
me
and
you
.

So
when
we
speak
,
we
are
not
trying
to
please

especially
since
the

was
expecting
that

end
after

In
August
1983
,
Mr.
Noriega
took
over
as
General
and
de-facto
dictator
of
Panama
,
having
maneuvered
his

two

after
the
mysterious
death
in

crash

This
shift
is
driven
by
the
combination
of
a
escalating
world
consumption
of
petroleum
,
especially
in

India
,
and
b
the
peaking
of

production
capacity

oil
reserves
that
remain

.

The
details
of
the
case
,
after
the
arrest
of
the
first
person
in
whose
possession
were
ten
pills
of
the
same
kind
that
were
seized
,
are
that
while
there
was
no
relation
or
connection
between
the
two
arrested
men
,
the
car
was
going
back
and
forth
between
the
Kingdom
and
his
country
,
which
made
the
road
guards
suspicious
of
a
concealed
matter
.

so
what
is
a
realistic
number
for
the
spring
.

In
Virginia
,
it
's
to
benefit
private
business
plans
and
not
to
serve
the
public
interest
.

The
main
premise
of
the
supercycle
theory
hangs
on
an
extremely
reliable
shortage
of
staple
commodities
;
this
shortage
was
created
because
in
the
last
20
-
odd
years
there
has
been
a
shortage
of
capital
to
invest
in
building
new
capacity
for
acquisition
and
processing
.

So
far
,
no
ally
has
complained
openly
,
preserving
the
impression
that
NATO
is
in
line
with
the
Bush
position
that
a
quick
agreement
bringing
Soviet
conventional
forces
down
to
parity
with
NATO
is
the
West
's
top
bargaining
priority
.

That
's
the
issue
right
there
.

it
's
one
of
the
most
exciting
uh
medical
developments
of
our
age
.

where
does
it
go

until
2005
,
the
Bush
administration
maintained
a
total
freeze
on
Iraqis
that
shut
out
current
refugees
as
well
as
hundreds
of
people
who
had
fled
Saddam
Hussein
's
regime
years
earlier
.

He
expects
stocks
to
decline
an
additional
5
%
to
30
%
,
with
the
Dow
perhaps
bottoming
out
between
2000
and
2100
``
between
now
and
June
.
''

It
's
with
the
administration
.

Other
possibilities
include
a
child
-
care
initiative
and
an
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.

We
should
not
be
involved
in
sexual
sin
or
any
kind
of
immoral
behavior
.

One
example
is
that
this
year
Toyota
Motor
has
invested
in
St.
Petersburg
.

The
move
will
make
the
drug
available
free
of
charge
for
a
time
to
children
with
the
disease
and
symptoms
of
advanced
infection
.

The
governor
made
a
lunch
banquet
for

``

will
happen
on
the
day
when
God
will
judge

secret
thoughts

Jesus
Christ

Currently
the
total
amount
of
foreign
capital
attracted
by
the
whole
industry
has
reached
5
billion
US
dollars

it

Beijing

North
Korea
's
political
climate
may
be
improving
,
but
its
economy
is
on
the
brink
of
collapse
.

However
,
like
the
stock
and
real
estate
markets
,
the
economy
tells
us
that
the
extreme
case
of
the
asset
markets
can
always
last
longer
than
we
anticipate
,
particularly
in
a
time
of
excess
current
capital
,
but
if
the
risk
assets
bubble
lasts
another

,
it
may
cause
more

I
think
you
look
at
the
totality
of
his
career

what
you
see
is
a
judge
squarely
within

Look
at

The

Now
it
's
clear
to
everybody
that
while
there
's
no
access
to
places

areas

When

it
is
sometimes
hard

Everyone

but
they

He
has

a
day
when

will

way

China
had
refused
to
repatriate
citizens
who
sneaked
into
Hong

illegally
since
early
this

when
the

allowed
a
dissident
Chinese
swimmer
to
flee
to
the

At

will
focus
on
a
series
of
new
policies
on
foreign

co-operation
that
are
to
be
announced
,
dealing
with
problems
capturing
the
attention
of

such
as
policies
on
the
reduction

Then
,
when

was
incorporated
in
1908
,
the

that

reside
in

blacks
could
work
there
,
but
they
had
to
leave

It
is
obvious
from
reading
about
all
these

that
we
find
that
the

these
successive

from
the
blows
that
assail

The
Bush
administration
is
the
Water
Margin
,
which
holds
up
the
flag
of
"
acting
for
the
god
"
without
the
authorization
of
Zhao
Jie
,
destructing
Zhujia
Village
today
and
eliminating
Zengtou
City
the
next
day
,
and
it
is
hard
to
say
if
it
is
attacking
Daming
City
the
day
after
.

Our
government
is
not
the
President

so
,
%mm.
it
was
really
quite
awful
.

It
's
up
to
my
husband
.

But
the
one
who
rejoices
when
the
camera
passes
over
her
and
stands
up
and
jumps
and
shouts
is
either
one
of
two
:.

Did
any
of
the
gods
of
the
other
nations
save
their
land
from
the
king
of
Assyria
?

If
Mr.
Gorbachev
is
looking
toward
unleashing
the
productive
forces
of
the
market
,
these
latest
resolutions
are
nothing
short
of
reckless
.

Saul
gathered
3000
of
the
best
soldiers
in
Israel
and
went
down
to
the
desert
of
Ziph
to
search
for
David
in
the
desert
of
Ziph
.

and
it
goes

You
should
praise
God
for
that
name
.

But
we
are
at
the
level
where
we
can
say
,
in
late
July
or
early
August
,
in
that
week
of
time
,

and
to
prove
it
they
lured
him
in
with
sweet
words
and
sweet
potatoes
.

You
know
it
's
%um

Through
Christ
,
God
gave
me
the
special
work
of
an
apostle
--
to
lead
people
of
all
nations
to
believe
and
obey
him
.

For
example
,
divide
a
large

into
groups
to
discuss
what
they
would
buy
with
NT$

The
Tianjin
Harbor
Bonded
Area
was
established
through
State
Department
approval
in
May
1991

in

of
the

year
,
formally
invited
businessmen
,
and
closed
customs
and
operating
in
April
1992

So
Joseph

``

and
I
love
him

``
Earlier
generations
were
brand
loyal
across
categories
,
''
he
says
,
``
but
boomers
tend
to
be
brand
loyal
in
categories
like
running
shoes
and
bottled
water
,
but
less
so
in
others
like

and

In
April
of
last
year
,
the
CR
Company
began
bankruptcy
procedures
and
the
debt
compensation
rate
of
all
its
assets
was
only
5
%
.

We
are
then
at
the
threshold
of
street
action
,
and
this
is
what
compelled
the
vice
president
of
the
Higher
Shiite
Council
,
Abdel
-
Amir
Qabalan
to
warn
from
going
into
the
streets
because
there
is
harm
and
corruption
in
this
action
.

Therefore
,
the
more
he
follows
the
US
,
the
lower
will
be
his
actual
status
in
Asia
.

The
Americans
were
involved
as
far
as
assessing
and
evaluating
the
validity
of
the
elections
,
and
I
think
this
grew
out
of
that
policy
of
supporting
the
Yemeni
government
,
but
again
the
problem
that
the
Yemeni
government
faces
is
they
do
n't
actively
control
the
countryside
.

Moreover
,
some
measures
implemented
by
Sichuan
Province
,
such
as
improving
the
soft
and
hard
environment
for
foreign
investment
,
alleviating
unreasonable
burdens
of
foreign
investment
enterprises
and
simplifying
formalities
for
examination
and
approval
,
etc.
,
also
played
an
active
role
in
inviting
businesses
and
attracting
investment
.

According
to
a
report
by
the
Spanish

declassified
documents

military
to
launch
a
military
coup

overthrowing
the
constitutional

In

that

that

hot
in

fighting
charges
that
it
bribed
Jamaican
officials
to
win
the

When
they
reapportion
their

every

In

He
said
other
than
that
option

of
Ministers

demand
ah

we
give
authorization
to
the
Lebanese
army
to

it
would
confiscate
the
weapons
without
you
having
to
hand
them
over
,
I
mean
,
by
hand

But
interest
instead
decreased
.

But
then
,
even
a

summarize
the

of
this

Part
of
the
problem
some
Europeans
have
with

from

he
had

And
like

went
into

I
'm
not

is
why
the

could
not
believe

had

And
I
think
that
's
the
real
question
we
have
to
answer
.

Well
,
during

,
er
,
President
Roh
Moo

hyun
clearly
pointed
out
,
ah
,
what
did
he
point
out
?

is
,
er
,
the

The
results
contradicted
the
facts
of
the
proceedings
and
proved
the
truth
of
what
we
referred
to
in
our
main
complaint
.

Indeed
,
only
hours
earlier
,
Mrs.

has
``

him

Like
Rice
,
Rice
herself
,
she
,
um
,
took
over
as
secretary
of
state
quite
late
,
so
she
is
not
to
blame
for
very
much
.

The
second
point
is
to
look
at
the
reaction
of
al

It
was

With

Our
main

that

do

is

if

looks
as
if
we
have
failed
the
test

Unfortunately
,
Russia
does
n't
have
a
political
mechanism
that
would
make
such
an
investigation
open
to
the
public
.

The
elite
are
in
the
majority
,
and
there
is
the
mainstream
media
as
well
--
they
do
not
mention
or
seldom
mention
the
socialist
spirit
and
thought
.

But
when
Law
and
her
husband

Fong
were
invited
to
attend

Taipei

Festival

revealed

However
,
whether
we
look
at
it
from
its
pattern
or
from
its
implications
,
accepting
such
donations
from
the
poor
is
precisely
what
causes
us
to
lose
the
most
basic
humanity
