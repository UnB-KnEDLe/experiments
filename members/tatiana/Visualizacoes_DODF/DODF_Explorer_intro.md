The scatter plot below is the result of running the t-SNE algorithm on DODF's datasets, resulting in a 3D visualization of the documents.

Official publications such as the Di√°rio Oficial do Distrito Federal (DODF) are sources of information on all official government acts. Although these documents are rich in knowledge, analysing these texts manually by specialists is a complex and unfeasible task considering the growing volume of documents, the result of the frequent number of publications in the Distrito Federal Government's (GDF) communication vehicle.

DODF Explorer aims to facilitate the visualization of such information using unsupervised machine learning methods and data visualization techniques. To learn more about how the DODF Explorer works, click on "Learn More" below.
